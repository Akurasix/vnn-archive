<p><a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/9940">Nostraightanswer</a>, also known as <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/9940">Lupin</a>, is a notable English Vocaloid music producer. Being full of creative talent, he has made plenty of songs that have his signature upbeat synthpop with undertones of &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s electronic pop. Lupin is also known for voicing Vocaloid <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/36169">DEX</a>, which he uses often ever since its release. <br><br>After working hard for the past few years, nostraightanswer has finally released his album <a href="https://nostraightanswer.bandcamp.com/album/syntech-2">SYNTECH+</a>, and the result is a flavorful mix of his past tracks revamped, alongside new ones that exude dark and colorful emotions akin to the sky at dusk.</p>

<h2>Review</h2>



<h4>1. Prelude to Dusk (Intro)</h4>



<p>You are welcomed to SYNTECH+ with Lupin&#8217;s thoughts on what these songs are about to him. The poem, though calming, asks us in this moment of calm if we have ever done enough and if it &#8220;Will ever be enough?&#8221;. The piano foreshadows the upcoming track, and then we notice the evening colored horizon drawing near.</p>



<h4>2.  <strong>Someday You&#8217;ll Notice The Evening Colored Horizon</strong> </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Someday You&#039;ll Notice The Evening Colored Horizon (feat. Hatsune Miku)" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8DdavFz_y4w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>High and uplifting synthesizers allures you to &#8220;Someday You&#8217;ll Notice The Evening Colored Horizon&#8221;. The beats and sparkles of the instruments mix together forming a serene yet bright ambiance accompanied by Miku&#8217;s charming voice. Complemented by the lyrics, the song becomes a sincerely heartfelt letter to the Vocaloid community. </p>



<h4>3. Define Me</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="[VOCALOID Original PV] Define Me [MAIKA Original Contest Winner]" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/czHGGKr1aCQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>A track with a strong sense of rhythm and syncopation. &#8220;Define Me&#8221; energetically sings about requesting someone to break you free of the walls you put up for protection yet closing you in isolation. Nostraightanswer&#8217;s use of Maika&#8217;s mature vocals puts forth the song&#8217;s desire to be free.</p>



<h4>4. Respire</h4>



<p>&#8220;Respire&#8221; oozes with sensuality.  The melody is catchy yet very intimate.  DEX&#8217;s attractive voice stands out well to the theme of the song. This track twinkles in your ear making you desire more of it.</p>



<h4>5. Pushing Daisies</h4>



<p>Despite the title being reminiscent of death, &#8220;Pushing Daisies&#8221; is full of life and emotion. Heartbreaking and poignant, this track laments the fall of a past relationship and the &#8220;What ifs&#8221;. Despite the bleak color of the lyrics, the instrumental is full of electric intrigue and brightness, bringing an excellent contrasting texture to an already impressive piece. </p>



<h4>6. My Impulse</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="[VOCALOID Original PV] My Impulse [DEX]" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F_MPc1RD3UM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The serene yet uncertain piano intro slowly escalates to a heavy guitar riff accompanied by an alarming melody, a warning that something is not right. This heavy electro-rock song shouts anxiety and how it happens even in the safest of places &#8211; and how you just want someone to &#8220;Tell me it&#8217;ll be alright /&nbsp;Tell me that I will be fine&#8221;. &nbsp; </p>



<h4>7. Infinity</h4>



<p>Arguably one of the most atmospheric tracks in the whole album. This song is a hero&#8217;s journey. Starting with a very shaky beginning, the apprehensive singer finds someone they look up to. As the splashes of the beats heighten, the hero opens up and strives to fight with the one they love to get their place in &#8220;Infinity&#8221;.</p>



<h4>8. Suffocate</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Suffocate [Official Audio]" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/geGvhywints?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>&#8220;Suffocate&#8221; is minimalist in the verses, holding out to sharpen and then escalates in the chorus. Intoning the lopsided power dynamics in their relationship, the satisfying rhymes and rhythm of the song leave the end of the story in ambiguity. </p>



<h4>9.  <strong>Pacify</strong> </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="[VOCALOID Original PV] Pacify [Hatsune Miku]" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoDjnQBqRJY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>A ballad about a relationship teetering at the edge of collapse. The singer is &#8220;Clinging and holding&#8230;&#8221; to keep her partner. The track builds up at the last chorus asking if there &#8220;Is there a way to pacify the pain?&#8221;</p>



<h4>10. Both Of Us</h4>



<p>Groovy instrumentals and lyrics bursting with confidence paint this duet of miscommunication to life. With either side belting to say that the quarrel is not solely one&#8217;s fault, nostraightanswer shows that Dex&#8217;s and Daina&#8217;s vocals were made to complement each other. </p>



<h4>11. Half-Life</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="[VOCALOID Original Song] Half-Life [AVANNA]" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-nhwTl1w7cU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Avanna begs for the companionship of a savior and how being apart would cause her grief. Grounded and unwinding the track soothes, contrasting the urgency of the lyrics to &#8220;stay still with me&#8221;. Like the title, the song contains messages that show how nature is withering from our misuse. </p>



<h4>12. You Get Me</h4>



<p>&#8220;You Get Me&#8221; discharges confidence from the intro to the coda, and all the lyrics inbetween. Most noteworthy, the pre-chorus sings intensity and drops to a catchy minimalist beat. And with that, the track closes SYNTECH+ with a powerful finale.</p>



<h4>Personal thoughts</h4>



<p>SYNTECH+ is an emotional roller coaster of a journey. First of all, I find it really interesting how the album captures a wide array of emotions and how every track encompasses a unique story. Another thing is that I would usually have a song that I would skip in an album, but SYNTECH+ doesn&#8217;t have any of those for me. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s good to note that the previously released tracks were remastered and &#8220;given new life&#8221; by Nostraightanswer. The changes were minimal yet so well done (especially in &#8220;Define Me&#8221;) that it is worthy to say that these are the penultimate versions. Furthermore, if I had to pick a favorite track (which is like picking your favorite child), it would have to be &#8220;Pushing Daisies&#8221;, because I fell in love with that song since I first heard it as Daina&#8217;s Demo. I was able to join Lupin&#8217;s live stream when he was finishing that song and I cried (more than I want to admit). Finally, I can say that SYNTECH+ will be joining the list of my favorite albums. </p>



<h2>Announcements</h2>



<p>SYNTECH+ is available right now on <strong>Bandcamp</strong>. And will be available in <strong>every other major music provider and streaming service</strong> on <strong>August 20</strong>, <strong>2019</strong>.<br><br>Lupin also announced that he will be releasing the &#8220;part two&#8221; of the project called, SYNTECH-. It will be a self-cover and remix album. SYNTECH- will be releasing on <strong>August 20, 2019</strong>.</p>

Among the announced songs is “<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/184869" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-hasqtip="2">Euphoria</a>,” the theme song to the <a href="http://www.ioinformatics.org/index.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30th International Olympiad in Infomatics (IOI)</a> to be held from September 1st through the 8th at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukuba,_Ibaraki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tsukuba City</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibaraki_Prefecture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ibaraki Prefecture</a> of Japan.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Onseogosei no Seiyujimusha, translated as &#8220;Voice Synth Voice Actors&#8217; Office&#8221; is far from new, they have a rather new addition that&#8217;s bringing the series of voice banks to new levels! In addition to their many talking voice banks, they now have a singing voice bank unlike any other.</p>
<h3>About Onseogosei no Seiyujimusha</h3>
<p>As mentioned, Onseogosei no Seiyujimusha translates to &#8220;Voice Synth Voice Actors&#8217; Office.&#8221; It&#8217;s a series of voice banks with a little bit of plot surrounding them. These banks are all members of an office and work to serve those who hire them.</p>
<p>Their introduction even sounds like an office secretary wrote it!</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8216;Onseogosei no Seiyujimusha&#8217; is a voice synth project that started in 2017 and is celebrating its first anniversary come this spring. Our voice synth software, which is capable of expressing emotions, will work hard to fit your needs!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>About the Software</h3>
<p>
<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cover_logo-1.png'><img width="300" height="137" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cover_logo-1-300x137.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cover_logo-1-300x137.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cover_logo-1.png 522w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>
</p>
<p>Onseogosei no Seiyujimusha utilizes the VoiceText engine by HOYA CORPORATION. Unfortunately, at this time, it&#8217;s only available commercially. However, there&#8217;s always a chance that this will change in the future!</p>
<p>The software&#8217;s official page advertises four special features of voice text: Emotion, Making Original Voices, Changing How the Voices Talk, and the Singing Synthesizer. The following points are translated from the website. Please note that the translations have been changed slightly to make more sense in English.</p>
<h5>Point 1: Emotion</h5>
<p>With VoiceText, happy, sad, and angry emotions are available. Through expression settings, you can control the strength and weakness of the voice. Through the emotions settings, you can control the strength of emotions. This allows you to have the phrase sound however you&#8217;d like it to. This makes for fun conversations featuring voices that don&#8217;t sound like robots but like humans.</p>
<h5>Point 2: Making Original Voices</h5>
<p>You can create your own original voice synth by recording your own voice or the voice of a voice actor. You can even revive the voice of people who have passed away. In addition to creating the voice itself and giving it emotions, you can attach special sentence-enders to all the sentences (like a cat ending every sentence with &#8220;Nyan!&#8221;). You can find an in-depth tutorial (in Japanese) <a href="http://voicetext.jp/products/vt-original/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h5>Point 3: Changing How They Talk</h5>
<p>You can combine a character&#8217;s voice with another character&#8217;s speaking style. You can combine characters with different accents to create new ways of speaking or combining two voices to make them cuter. Perfect for people who want a different voice from those provided.</p>
<h5>Singing Synthesizer</h5>
<p>You input the melody and lyrics, and create a song. Unlike other vocal synths, it doesn&#8217;t go by one sound at a time but instead uses a statistical model to create smooth and clear singing. It has the warmth of a human being singing.</p>
<p>They are using a new style of singing voice synthesis technology developed mainly by Professor Keiichi Tokuda of Nagoya Institute of Technology, and speech analysis and synthesis system <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/transinf/E99.D/7/E99.D_2015EDP7457/_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WORLD</a> developed by Professor Masanori Morise of Yamanashi University.</p>
<h3>The Characters</h3>
<p>At the moment, there are 11 characters capable of speaking — one of whom is debuting as an idol. Unless otherwise stated, the voice is capable of happy, sad, and angry emotions.</p>
<h4>The Newcomer Idol</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Startup company Eclipsed Sounds is running a Kickstarter to help bring Western VOCALOID merchandise to fans. While they&#8217;re just starting out, they have big plans for the future.</p>
<h3>About Eclipsed Sounds</h3>
<p>The Eclipsed Sounds startup will be a new pathway for fans to purchase English VOCALOID character merchandise. They plan to develop into a physical store with space for synth music lessons, concerts, and collaborations. Eclipsed Sounds will begin as an online retailer utilizing Kickstarters to build a fan-base, before growing into a larger online retailer to provide design-of-the-month offerings as limited-run products. After moving out of the “pre-order” phase, the company will offer in-person sales at large anime and music conventions, and online sales of fan-art. They are collaborating with artists who do not routinely sell their products online to provide greater access to their work.</p>
<h3>The Kickstarter</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On this day last year, the much anticipated American English VOCALOIDs DEX &amp; DAINA were finally released after a bit of waiting on the go-ahead from YAMAHA. Fans were delighted to see these VOCALOIDs come into the spotlight, but never would we have imagined that these two would go so far in such little time. So today, we&#8217;re celebrating the first birthday of DEX &amp; DAINA by looking back at the past year and how much these two VOCALOIDs have grown.</p>
<h3>Release</h3>
<p>EmpathP and Kenji-B promoted DEX &amp; DAINA as much as they could and, as a result, the two were very anxiously awaited. Fans would tune in to live streams for all of the DEX and DAINA updates and, after much anticipation, the two were released with much celebration.</p>
<p>EmpathP and Kenji-B made several demos featuring the two, some of which were released while one stayed hidden until recently when the <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/Al/19907" target="_blank">VOCAMERICA Official Soundtrack</a></em> was released.</p>
<p>Fans grabbed up DEX &amp; DAINA, and the two did very well for English VOCALOIDs. But their release was only the beginning of their rise.</p>
<h3>Popular Songs</h3>
<p>DEX &amp; DAINA have seen their fair share of popular songs. While none have hit an incredibly high mark, many have seen relatively high success when compared to other English VOCALOID songs.</p>

<h5>&#8220;Secret Garden&#8221;</h5>
<p>In addition to popular songs outside of those made by EmpathP and Kenji-B, there&#8217;s also one song that blew up not only in the VOCALOID fandom but also crossed into the <em>Undertale</em> fandom as well. &#8220;Secret Garden&#8221; marked the first song in a series of <em>Undertale</em> inspired VOCALOID originals, and it grew incredibly popular very fast.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wH3bMZXA4W8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to using DEX as the voice of Sans, it also uses CYBER DIVA and DAINA for the female vocals.</p>
<p>This is likely one of the most viewed English VOCALOID songs in existence.</p>
<h3>VOCAMERICA</h3>
<p>And, of course, you can&#8217;t mention DEX &amp; DAINA without VOCAMERICA! The Western VOCALOID Concert project is one of EmpathP&#8217;s biggest projects and features the two birthday VOCALOIDs as the headlining acts. The two received merchandise and, of course, got to perform on stage for fans! The first concert went incredibly well and people are excited for the next one.</p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>Within the first year of their release, DEX &amp; DAINA have accomplished more than a lot of VOCALOIDs ever do. The two aren&#8217;t as successful as many other VOCALOIDs but, at the same time, they&#8217;ve seen a huge deal of success when compared to most Western VOCALOIDs. And their success is bringing success to other Western VOCALOIDs as well. As the two continue on their VOCAMERICA path and people continue to use them, they&#8217;re sure to keep doing well.</p>
<p>Hopefully by this time next year, DEX &amp; DAINA will be even more popular. So let&#8217;s continue to support them for years to come!</p>
