<p>It&#8217;s been nearly a year since the last official update from VOCALOID4 <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/28174">UNI&#8217;s</a> parent company, <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/40835">ST Media</a>. But big news just hit from their official YouTube: a new album is over the horizon!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="836" height="416" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-27-at-7.27.22-AM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-248293" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-27-at-7.27.22-AM.png 836w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-27-at-7.27.22-AM-300x149.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-27-at-7.27.22-AM-800x398.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 836px) 100vw, 836px" /></figure>



<p>UNI&#8217;s latest album, <em><a href="http://characterplanet.net/shop/pre-order-album-24hours-srs/"><strong>24-Hour Symphony</strong></a>, </em>is now available to pre-order! The album is set to come out on December 16, 2019. Pre-orders run from 11/27 &#8211; 12/14, so get yours in to qualify for some sweet bonuses! The price is currently set for 18,000 won (~$15 USD), not including shipping.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="845" height="845" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/album_thumb_1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-248306" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/album_thumb_1.png 845w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/album_thumb_1-300x300.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/album_thumb_1-150x150.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/album_thumb_1-800x800.png 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/album_thumb_1-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" /></figure>



<p>The album will feature music by renowned Korean VOCALOID producer, <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/13505">Sangnoksu</a> (Evergreen, theyears12, ProgressU).  <em>24-Hour Symphony</em> is actually the first album by the esteemed artist in nearly six years! </p>



<p>The tracklist is filled with a mixture of covers and originals, all sung by the world&#8217;s first Korean V4.</p>



<h4>Tracklist</h4>



<ol><li><a href="https://vocadb.net/S/200614">천년의 시 (The Poem of a Millennia) &#8211; UNI ver.</a></li><li><a href="https://vocadb.net/S/148820">Installation</a></li><li><a href="https://vocadb.net/S/153845">벚꽃비 (Cherry Blossoms in the Rain)</a></li><li>25시 (25 o&#8217;clock)</li><li><a href="https://vocadb.net/S/70555">행성의 소나타 (Sonata Planet) &#8211; UNI ver.</a></li><li><a href="https://vocadb.net/S/75938">해에게서 달까지 (From the Sun to the Moon) &#8211; UNI ver.</a></li><li>태양이 춤추는 나라 (The Land Where the Sun Dances)</li><li><a href="https://vocadb.net/S/214765">20년 뒤의 나에게 (20 Years Later to Me)</a></li><li>다물 (Tea)</li><li><a href="https://vocadb.net/S/214764">24시간의 교향곡 (24-Hour Symphony)</a></li></ol>



<p>There are several songs that are homages to the original SeeU versions, reworked to feature UNI&#8217;s vocals! </p>



<p>The album also features UNI originals, including a demo song from Sangnoksu and one of her first originals. Not only that, but it also features three completely new songs currently exclusive to this album!</p>



<h4>Preorder Bonuses</h4>



<p>While the preorder period for the album is a little over two weeks, there are some bonuses ST Media announced. While supplies last, people who purchase the album could receive a couple different items!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="416" height="276" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-27-at-7.44.46-AM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-248319" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-27-at-7.44.46-AM.png 416w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-27-at-7.44.46-AM-300x199.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-27-at-7.44.46-AM-310x205.png 310w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></figure>



<p>The first preorder bonus is a 10cm x 15cm illustration card featuring the album cover. This is an enticing prize by itself, but there&#8217;s another potential product you can get, as well!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="219" height="396" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-27-at-7.44.59-AM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-248332" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-27-at-7.44.59-AM.png 219w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-27-at-7.44.59-AM-166x300.png 166w" sizes="(max-width: 219px) 100vw, 219px" /></figure>



<p>People who preorder quickly enough can also receive an MR download card of the album for digital use!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Way back in the beginning of August 2015, ST Media revealed a silhouette of the upcoming Korean VOCALOID UNI. Fans loved UNI so much that it took less than two hours to reach the goal of revealing her official design! You can find more information on this <a href="/vocaloid-uni-illustration-revealed/">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/11836695_546479295504083_2272747683561241238_n.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-10022" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/11836695_546479295504083_2272747683561241238_n.jpg" alt="11836695_546479295504083_2272747683561241238_n" width="484" height="642" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/11836695_546479295504083_2272747683561241238_n.jpg 679w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/06/11836695_546479295504083_2272747683561241238_n-226x300.jpg 226w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px" /></a></p>
<p>Fan were very eager to hear more about her and to hear her voice.</p>
<p>As promised when we partnered with ST Media, we will be bringing you all UNI news first-hand. The time has finally come for some more UNI news! Below is a special message from ST Media to all VOCALOID and UNI fans:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hello ~</p>
<p>We are ST Media and we apologize to have kept you waiting so long for more information on UNI. For that, we thank you very much for your expectations of UNI.</p>
<p>We are doing our best to develop UNI&#8217;s voice bank, so please trust us and be patient for a few more months! We have some more information for all of you!</p>
<p>We will tell you about UNI&#8217;s voice banks and you can hear her voice sample! (Her voice is the &#8220;Soft version&#8221; of her voice bank. It is currently in development.)</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6exRuh0NJhQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>[FAQ]</p>
<p><strong>1) When will UNI be released?</strong></p>
<p>The release schedule has been delayed because we want to upgrade the database quality. We are discussing with YAMAHA to release it in September of this year.</p>
<p><strong>2) What kinds of voices will UNI&#8217;s voice bank have? And what languages?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently developing UNI&#8217;s voice bank for the V4 engine. She will have more than two tones. We want to make it so you can use the &#8220;Cross Synthesis&#8221; function with the V4 editor. This fall, we will release UNI&#8217;s Korean voice bank. Later, we plan to release UNI&#8217;s English library during the spring of 2017.</p>
<p><strong>3) </strong><strong>Who is the voice provider for UNI?</strong></p>
<p>Actually, UNI&#8217;s voice provider was changed for a few reasons since this was a very critical experience for us. We came across many issues with the voice provider and realized it could be risky for our character to reveal the voice provider, so we will continue discussing it. Rest assured that the voice provider is a pro and she is doing her best for UNI with us.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>We are very sorry that we couldn&#8217;t reveal anything about UNI until now. But from now on, we are going to tell you many things about UNI and others. Please be patient, and show some love for UNI and VOCALOID.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>VOCALOID has been capable of giving people the chance to make their own songs and use voice banks represented by virtual idols to sing those songs. One of the things that’s very impressive is that these voice banks can sing in a number of languages. For the most part, we’re aware that VOCALOIDs can sing in Japanese, as well as English. But the software isn&#8217;t limited to just those two languages. From Spanish to Chinese, there are VOCALOIDs that are designed to sing in languages that are beyond what we are typically used to hear from them. For this editorial, the focus will be on the ones that sing in languages that aren’t just Japanese or English. Let’s take a trip to the VOCALOIDs of other languages.</p>
<h3>Korean</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_1133" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1133" style="width: 598px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SeeU-2-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1133 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SeeU-598x1024-1.png" alt="" width="598" height="1024" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1133" class="wp-caption-text">SeeU&#8217;s Official Art</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Let’s turn our attention to the first language sung by a VOCALOID that wasn’t solely Japanese and/or English. The VOCALOID 1 and VOCALOID 2 softwares both were limited to their voice banks singing in either of the two aforementioned languages. It wasn’t until VOCALOID 3 where that began to change. <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/193" target="_blank">SeeU</a> (released in October 2011), was the first VOCALOID to sing in a language besides Japanese or English: Korean. However, she is also capable of singing in Japanese.</p>
<p>A few of her Korean language songs include <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/8461" target="_blank"><em>Shining</em> <em>Star</em></a>, <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/8449" target="_blank">RUN</a></em>, and <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/8463" target="_blank"><em>Umbrella</em></a> (not to be confused with the Rihanna song). At this time, SeeU is the only VOCALOID with a Korean voice bank.</p>
<p>There is a new virtual singer that has been announced to also sing in Korean. Her name is <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/28174" target="_blank">UNI</a> and she was originally announced in November 2014 with <a href="https://rayduxz.cl/vocaloid/2015/08/04/vocaloid-uni-illustration-revealed/" target="_blank">an updated announcement</a> in August 2015 and expected release date of sometime in 2015.</p>

<h3>Spanish</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_1153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1153" style="width: 1001px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrunoClara-1-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1153 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrunoClara-1-1001x1024-1.jpg" alt="" width="1001" height="1024" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1153" class="wp-caption-text">Bruna and Clara&#8217;s Boxart</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The next new language to be introduced to the program was Spanish. The first duo to sing in Spanish were <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/384" target="_blank">Bruno</a> and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/385" target="_blank">Clara</a>. There was a bit of controversy with these two, not so much because of their singing, but more because of their design. Regardless, their release was still in 2011.</p>
<p>Their songs are typically sung together or Clara singing with <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/13431" target="_blank">MAIKA</a>, the third Spanish singing VOCALOID.</p>
<p>However, they still have some songs that they sing on their own. Clara’s songs include <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/68687" target="_blank"><em>A Banshee Named 42</em></a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/66226" target="_blank"><em>Más que Nada</em></a>, and <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/66235" target="_blank">Un día de Amistad</a></em>.</p>
<p>A few of Bruno’s solo songs are <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/9351" target="_blank">El manisero</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr04KyG5BWE" target="_blank">La Flaka</a></em>, and <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/9354" target="_blank"><em>El Makoki</em></a>.</p>
<p>You can hear Bruno and Clara singing together in<em> <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/68783" target="_blank">Blanco &amp; Negro</a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/68683" target="_blank">Electronegative</a>, </em>and<em> <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/67989" target="_blank">Ballroom Breakdown</a></em>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xAjReUIycZY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1154" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1154" style="width: 1001px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MAIKA-1-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1154 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MAIKA-1-1001x1024-1.jpg" alt="" width="1001" height="1024" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1154" class="wp-caption-text">MAIKA&#8217;s Box Art</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The next VOCALOID to sing in Spanish was MAIKA. She was released in December of 2013, two years after Bruno and Clara were made available. It should also be noted that MAIKA is also capable of singing in Catalan as heard in <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/41607" target="_blank">Fantasia</a></em>, along with Brazilian Portuguese (<em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/98768" target="_blank">Garota de Ipanema</a></em>) and Italian (<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/98769" target="_blank"><em>Una Notte a Napoli</em></a>) thanks to extra phonemes added to her voice bank. These are languages that have yet to be sung by any other VOCALOID.</p>
<p>Back on to MAIKA’s Spanish songs, a couple of examples would be <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/40572" target="_blank">En tu Mirar</a></em> and<em> <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/44227" target="_blank">Ni Una Sola Palabra</a></em>. Beyond these three VOCALOIDs, there are no other Spanish voice banks to talk about and there are currently no announcements on the development of another Spanish voice bank.</p>

</p>
<p>Continuing the languages of VOCALOID 3, there is <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/1778" target="_blank">Luo Tianyi</a> (on the left), a female voice capable of singing in Mandarin Chinese. Her initial release was in July 2012. A few of her songs in Mandarin include <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/13721" target="_blank"><em>March Rain</em></a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/13723" target="_blank"><em>Millennium Recipe Song</em></a>, and <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/13722" target="_blank">Natural Story</a></em>.</p>
<p>Following in her footsteps, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/10025" target="_blank">YANHE</a> (on the right) came next as the second female Mandarin Chinese voice bank. She was released one year after Tianyi in July 2013 and her songs include <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/32614" target="_blank">Rain of Dreams</a></em> and <em>Stage 1</em>.</p>

</p>
<p>Xin Hua was released this year, 2015, in the month of February but fans knew about her as early as 2014. She&#8217;s the third released female Mandarin Chinese vocal. It&#8217;s worth noting that she was the first Chinese VOCALOID to come from Taiwan. Her songs include <em>Shī</em> and <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/93630" target="_blank"><em>Huá Xīn Cǎi</em></a>.</p>
<p>Also released this year was <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/23972" target="_blank">Yuezheng Ling</a>, the fourth public mandarin Chinese female vocal. She was released during the month of July. There aren’t many songs with her as of now, but you can still listen to her in <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/90012" target="_blank"><em>Scarlet Drop</em></a><em> and </em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/90963" target="_blank"><em>Mèng Yǔ</em></a>.</p>
<p>There are three Chinese singing VOCALOIDs currently in production: <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/35966" target="_blank">Stardust</a>, <span class="extraInfo"><a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/23974" target="_blank">Zhanyin Lorra</a></span>, and <span class="extraInfo"><a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/39621" target="_blank">Yuezheng Longya</a>,</span> with Longya confirmed to be the first male Chinese vocal after many fans were upset after Stardust (the 6th female Chinese voice bank) was announced. There is also a Chinese prototype of <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/15665" target="_blank">Macne Nana</a> that was set aside for future release.</p>
<p>Whether any of the future Chinese VOCALOIDs will be capable of singing in Cantonese is unknown at this time.</p>

<h3>Are There Any More Languages They Can Sing?</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_1251" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1251" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://rayduxz.cl/vocaloid/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/08/the_best_moment_by_sartika3091-d6sc6ro.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1251 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/the_best_moment_by_sartika3091-d6sc6ro-1.jpg" alt="Art by sartika3091 on Deviantart" width="1000" height="676" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1251" class="wp-caption-text">Art by <a href="http://sartika3091.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">sartika3091</a> on <a href="http://sartika3091.deviantart.com/art/The-Best-Moment-410394948" target="_blank">DeviantArt</a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>At the time of this editorial, there aren’t any other languages that have been confirmed that future VOCALOIDs will be able to sing in. Though Macne Nana had the possibility of obtaining a French voice bank, the possibility of it happening has been determined to be limited.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean more languages won’t happen, though. It’ll most likely take some time because it&#8217;s necessary to consider the pronunciations and dialects that need to be incorporated to resemble human speech.</p>
<p>VOCALOID is growing in popularity worldwide with the help of concerts taking place in China, Spain, France, Indonesia, and the United States. Who knows what the next language will be? Maybe one day VOCALOIDs will be capable of singing in all of the major languages of the world.</p>
<p>What languages would you like to hear VOCALOIDs singing in? It can be a new one that has yet to happen or one that you feel doesn’t get used enough.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A while back we got an announcement for VOCALOID UNI, a new Korean VOCALOID created by ST MEDiA. The project went quiet for a while. However, recently they have started answering fan questions and it seems like a release was on its way in the near future. Today they released a silhouette of UNI and promised if they reached 300 likes they would reveal her before the 15th of August as planned.</p>
<p>A message from Vocaloid Talks:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hello, this is Vocaloid Talks, what&#8217;s going on? That was really fast! This seemed impossible but we reached our goal! We have released her official illustration as promised. Her basic concept is based on strawberry milk, we matched the color of her neck and wrist accessories based on the feelings of Korea.</p>
<p>Please love UNI!</p>
<p>Illustration by OSUK2.</p></blockquote>
