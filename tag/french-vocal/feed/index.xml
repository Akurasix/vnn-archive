										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The newest Alter/Ego &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/51585">LEORA</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16810">VoxWave</a> has now officially been released! If you are not familiar with LEORA, she is a French and English voice bank for the Alter/Ego software. This is the second voice bank by VoxWave, who also created the French and Japanese voice bank &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16811">ALYS</a>&#8221; for the same engine. She is voiced by the French YouTaite <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16693">TBK</a>.</p>

<li><a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/57702">French Core</a></li>
<li><a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/57703">French Power</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Currently only her French voice banks is available, however, her English voice banks will be added for free in a later update. She is currently an early access and is still in development.</p>

<p>LEORA is <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16810">VoxWave</a>&#8216;s second voice bank and is meant to complement ALYS. Like ALYS, she will be a French virtual singer for the software Alter/Ego. We currently do not have much information on her, but we do know that she is currently in development and that she is voiced by <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16693">TBK</a>.</p>
<p>You can find her voice samples below. Keep in mind that this is only a pre-Alpha version. The song is actually a cover of an ALYS song, and you can find the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWEzDN974fM">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-4597 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ALYS-2.jpg" alt="ALYS" width="378" height="459" />After much anticipation, ALYS is finally receiving a commercial voice bank. She will be able to sing in both Japanese and French. ALYS will be for the <a href="https://www.plogue.com/products/alterego/" target="_blank">Alter/Ego</a> engine.<br />
According to Plogue (the creator of Alter/Ego):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Alter/Ego is based on the award winning technology featured in <a title="chipspeech" href="https://www.plogue.com/products/chipspeech">chipspeech</a> but instead of targeting Vintage voice technology, it focuses on more ‘modern’ (1990+) singing synthesis algorithms and research. It is specially tailored for musical needs – simply type in your lyrics, and then play on your MIDI keyboard. It’s a true synthesizer, the sound can be extensively modified for easy and expressive performances.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The ALYS preorder is 10% off the final release price and is €90.00 inside of Europe. Those outside of Europe can get the voice for €75.00 ($84.94 USD) once they sign up or sign in to their account. Only a digital version is available at the moment with no word on a physical release.</p>
<p>You can preorder the digital version on VoxWave&#8217;s official website <a href="http://shop.voxwave.fr/en/alys/63-alys-for-alterego.html" target="_blank">here</a>. ALYS is set to be released on March 10th.</p>
<p>Currently, the only song featuring ALYS&#8217; Alter/Ego bank is one of her very early beta. However, we&#8217;ve been told that a new demo should be out soon.</p>
