										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>Two days ago we <a href="/bunraku-beyond-event-has-been-cancelled/">reported</a> that the &#8220;<strong>Ningyo Joruri x Hatsune Miku &#8211;</strong> <strong>BUNRAKU Beyond</strong>&#8221; show was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the world and that a livestream show would be taking its place. However, today it was announced that said live broadcast has been <strong>cancelled</strong> as well.</p>
<p>In an official statement on the <a href="http://blog.piapro.net/2020/03/f2003271-1.html">Hatsune Miku Official Blog</a>, organizers said the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;Regarding the performance of “<strong>Ningyo Joruri x Hatsune Miku &#8211; BUNRAKU Beyond</strong>”, we have continued to make adjustments to distribute live audience performances via streaming but due to the expanding infectious state of the coronavirus disease we have decided, at the request of Tokyo&#8217;s Governor Koike, to cancel the scheduled live video distribution.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has made it impossible for us to provide live audiences and performers the required safety on a health standpoint.</p>
<p>We deeply apologize to many of you who were looking forward to our show.&#8221;</p>
<h3><strong>Refunds</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Nico Nico Live Broadcasting</strong><br />
For users who have already purchased the livestream ticket for the show, your Nico Nico Points will be returned soon as possible. Once the Nic0 Nico Points have been returned, we will contact you with the email address you&#8217;ve registered at the time of your purchase.</p>
<p>We urge you to wait until you&#8217;re contacted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past weekend, I was one of the many VOCALOID fans to attend Anime Weekend Atlanta. At long last, <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/2347">1st Place</a> debuts ARIA; a story of life, love and peace.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t be sharing too much information on the contents for those that want to experience it themselves without prior knowledge. There was a wonderful story that continued from beginning to end, with lots of unexpected <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/504">IA</a> and <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/31062">ONE</a> lore sprinkled in.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very clear how much 1st Place cares for IA, ONE and their fans. The concert was fantastic from a visual, story and musical standpoints. Several new songs were created for the concert and I would highly recommend checking out the <a href="https://vocadb.net/Al/27093">soundtrack</a> when possible.</p>
<p>Another highlight was certainly the live dancers. There were some very complicated moves they pulled off that made the crowd go absolutely wild. The choreography was amazing and the dancers were spot on. The costumes were just as good; in particular, I loved the complexity of the first one.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>(Some people got to take pictures with IA, depending on what ticket they purchased. What a beautiful outfit!)</p>
<p>Outside the concert was a booth full of IA and ONE merchandise. I may or may not have spent at least $80 there, but it was totally worth it. At the booth was also an AR poster, where you could take a picture of IA and ONE!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Please continue to support 1st Place and other companies, and request concerts like this or VOCAMERICA to come to a local convention near you! I look forward to seeing where ARIA and IA go next.</p>

<p>We always dreamed of attending a sea lion show when we were little, but who would have ever thought to see one themed after Hatsune Miku!

All of those exhibitions will be held during all of their performances starting from February 23rd. There will also be some shows on March 2nd and 17th as well! Those shows will be held at 3 PM JST, be sure to not miss them!</p>
<h3>Special attractions</h3>
