<p>China&#8217;s most popular virtual idol, Luo Tianyi, had her latest live performance at the end of the decade!</p>

</figure>



<p>She performed alongside renowned pipa master, Fang Jinlong, in a classic rendition of Mòlìhuā. The song is highly popular in China and Taiwan, especially among VOCALOID fans. This is because Mòlìhuā became almost tradition for Chinese VOCALOIDs to use as a demo song.</p>



<p>So it is only natural that Tianyi sing the sweet, simple song to herald in the new decade and close out the last!</p>



<p>According to Weibo, Tianyi&#8217;s performance was a part of Bilibili&#8217;s 2019 New Years&#8217; Celebration. This event featured several extremely popular performers and artists. Luo Tianyi had the honor of being one of them!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="690" height="447" class="wp-image-249105" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ENHhd8TWoAEc-V2.png" alt="" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ENHhd8TWoAEc-V2.png 690w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ENHhd8TWoAEc-V2-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" />
<figcaption>Luo Tianyi&#8217;s performance outfit; <a href="https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=610906522207&amp;ybhpss=c3VicGxhdD13ZWlibyZwYWdlPXNob3BfaW5kZXgmY3BpZD0wJmNudGlkPTAmcHVpZD0mcGd1aWQ9MSZ0cz0xNTc4MjA2OTkzJmNoYW5uZWw9MCwwJml0ZW1faWQ9NjEwOTA2NTIyMjA3JnBpdGVtaWQ9MjE4MDE1Nzc3ODU0MzUwMDM2OTI0NzcwJiZsYWJlbD13ZWlib19jY19idXk%253D">illustration available as for purchase via Taobao</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Unfortunately, the official performance is inaccessible through Bilibili. Because the 3.5 hour event was region-locked, viewers outside of China are unable to watch.</p>



<p>However, Vsinger&#8217;s Weibo account features her part of the special event! The full performance is four and a half minutes long. <a href="https://www.weibo.com/tv/v/Inn2J9dzT?fid=1034:4455642010681397"><strong>View it on Weibo, here</strong></a>!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/D61F37B8-7523-42A9-B585-F1F0B35A6680.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-249166" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/D61F37B8-7523-42A9-B585-F1F0B35A6680-1024x579.jpeg" alt="" width="618" height="349" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/D61F37B8-7523-42A9-B585-F1F0B35A6680-1024x579.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/D61F37B8-7523-42A9-B585-F1F0B35A6680-300x170.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/D61F37B8-7523-42A9-B585-F1F0B35A6680-1536x868.jpeg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/D61F37B8-7523-42A9-B585-F1F0B35A6680-800x452.jpeg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/D61F37B8-7523-42A9-B585-F1F0B35A6680.jpeg 1991w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a></p>



<p>The entire concert is magical from start to finish. In addition to Luo Tianyi&#8217;s sweet voicebank, her tuning compliments Fang&#8217;s pipa playing very well. The mixture of traditional instruments with modern technology is always a treat to watch! If you haven&#8217;t had a chance to see Tianyi&#8217;s performance, catch it while you still can!</p>



<p>Finally, Tianyi&#8217;s duet with Fang Jinlong acted as another interesting live collaboration. Previous events saw Tianyi singing <a href="/luo-tianyi-performed-let-it-go-at-jiangsu-countdown-concert-2018/">&#8220;Let It Go&#8221; alongside Wakin Chow</a>, and a <a href="/luo-tianyi-concert-with-%e6%9c%97%e6%9c%97lang-lang/">concert performance with pianist Lang Lang</a>!</p>



<p>Other events include a <a href="/luo-tianyi-concert-performance-with-%e8%96%9b%e4%b9%8b%e8%b0%a6xue-zhiqian-on-youku/">live television performance with Xue Zhiqian</a> and a singing part during the <a href="/luo-tiany-lizhi-voice-festival/">Lizhi Voice Festival</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes guys, and girls especially, you are reading right: <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/1778">Luo Tianyi</a> is collaborating again with <a href="https://www.happywhisper.com.cn/">Whisper</a> to sell some very unique sanitary pads!</p>
<h3>Lyrical Pads For You!</h3>
<p>This is not the first time we see Tianyi collaborating for that kind of products! She previously lend her voice for a promotional song and even had her own exclusive product line.</p>
<p>Now, it seems they decided to make a step further by offering sanitary pads not only with a new set of illustrations made by <a href="https://weibo.com/n/_Haku白_">Haku白</a>, and an awesome main visual by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/35921">TID</a>, but also the lyrics of some very familiar songs on it!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-225107" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/005CgOGzgy1g3ek0eca0yj30u016f7wm.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="976" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/005CgOGzgy1g3ek0eca0yj30u016f7wm.jpg 690w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/005CgOGzgy1g3ek0eca0yj30u016f7wm-212x300.jpg 212w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" /></p>
<p>Those sanitary pads come in a special box, each containing 8 packs of 10 pads (240mm, for a total of 80 units), priced <strong>199 RMB</strong>.</p>
<p>You can take them with you and enjoy their packaging featuring those adorable chibi artworks!</p>
<p>
<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ea29c9232d0a91e4.jpg'><img width="227" height="300" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ea29c9232d0a91e4-227x300.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ea29c9232d0a91e4-227x300.jpg 227w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ea29c9232d0a91e4.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" /></a>
<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/005CgOGzgy1g3e4jm9wnoj31400u0u0y.jpg'><img width="300" height="225" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/005CgOGzgy1g3e4jm9wnoj31400u0u0y-300x225.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/005CgOGzgy1g3e4jm9wnoj31400u0u0y-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/005CgOGzgy1g3e4jm9wnoj31400u0u0y.jpg 690w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>
</p>
<p>There is also a peculiarity that we should mention: each package features lyrics quotes from some of Tianyi songs on them!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-225131" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chrome_2019-05-26_14-00-51.png" alt="" width="910" height="584" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chrome_2019-05-26_14-00-51.png 910w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chrome_2019-05-26_14-00-51-300x193.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chrome_2019-05-26_14-00-51-800x513.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px" /></p>
<p>You may recognize them! &#8220;<a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/av27098340/">Whisper Girl</a>&#8221; was their promotional song in the past collaboration, while <a href="https://vocadb.net/S/48299">66CCFF</a> (by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/17330">Sugita Akira</a>, lyrics by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/18684">Haoyue</a>) and <a href="https://vocadb.net/S/145698">Light Chaser</a> (by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/56244">Michael Lin</a>, lyrics by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/56245">Yi Jiayang</a>), are probably some of this singing angel&#8217;s most well known songs! Here is a rough translation of the lyrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Comfortable and full of vitality&#8221; &#8211;<strong>Whisper Girl</strong></li>
<li>&#8220;I want this dimension to hear the color of my voice&#8221; &#8211;<strong>66CCFF</strong></li>
<li>&#8220;How long did the angel follow the light trek in the stars&#8217; ocean?&#8221; &#8211;<strong>Light Chaser</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>A big thanks to AiRen CANDYloid for 66CCFF and Light Chaser&#8217;s translations!</em></p>
<p>Must admit that, using well known lyrics on the packaging makes the experience a bit more.. enjoyable! It surely is a nice idea to let fans temporary forget their little monthly inconvenience.</p>
<p>Pre-orders will open at <strong>12PM (EDT)</strong> via <a href="https://item.jd.com/100005503992.html">JingDong&#8217;s TMall product page</a>, and you must be fast as only 2,500 units of this box will be produced!</p>
<h3>Giveaway</h3>
<p>Last but not least, they are also having a little giveaway via Tianyi&#8217;s Weibo account!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-225167" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chrome_2019-05-26_15-01-38.png" alt="" width="596" height="607" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chrome_2019-05-26_15-01-38.png 596w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chrome_2019-05-26_15-01-38-295x300.png 295w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /> By sharing their <a href="https://www.weibo.com/5146173015/HvXtvv9AH">post on Weibo</a>, you will get the chance of winning a special chibi figure from them!</p>
