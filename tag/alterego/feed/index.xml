										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The newest Alter/Ego &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/51585">LEORA</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16810">VoxWave</a> has now officially been released! If you are not familiar with LEORA, she is a French and English voice bank for the Alter/Ego software. This is the second voice bank by VoxWave, who also created the French and Japanese voice bank &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16811">ALYS</a>&#8221; for the same engine. She is voiced by the French YouTaite <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16693">TBK</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/leora-for-alterego.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-117990" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/leora-for-alterego.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="800" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/leora-for-alterego.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/leora-for-alterego-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/leora-for-alterego-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>If you liked ALYS, then you will also like LEORA. Not only that, with an English voice bank, English users will be able to finally try out an English Alter/Ego by VoxWave!</p>
<p>She will come with four voice banks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/57704">English Core</a></li>
<li><a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/57705">English Power</a></li>
<li><a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/57702">French Core</a></li>
<li><a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/57703">French Power</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Currently only her French voice banks is available, however, her English voice banks will be added for free in a later update. She is currently an early access and is still in development.</p>
<p>You can purchase her on VoxWave&#8217;s official website for €70,00 EUR ($80 USD) <a href="http://shop.voxwave.fr/en/leora/81-leora-for-alterego.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to have an idea of what she sounds like, there is a demo of her as well!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VoxWave</a> attended Dokomi in Germany! And, of course, it wouldn&#8217;t be a full VoxWave party without <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16693" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Baka Kitsune (TBK)</a>, Co-Founder of VoxWave, Youtaite, and voice provider of <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/51585" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LEORA</a>. The German division of VNN was lucky enough to be able to ask her a few questions about everything she&#8217;s involved in. Here&#8217;s VNN&#8217;s interview with TBK!</p>
<h3>The Interview</h3>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong><em> How are you enjoying Dokomi and Germany so far?</em></p>
<p><strong>TBK:</strong> It&#8217;s really great! I came to Germany for the last time five years ago, so I was really happy to be able to come back here. It&#8217;s a great time and opportunity to practice my German, too!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong><em> Is there anything you personally want to say to your fans?</em></p>
<p><strong>TBK:</strong> Keep loving virtual singers! This team is awesome, okay? And keep doing what you like in life. Everything is good, everything is great!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>Regarding your recent work on LEORA, how was recording for you?</em></p>
<p><strong>TBK:</strong> I already did record an UTAU before, my UTAU <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16694" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guren Nataku</a>, so I was kinda used to the process. But it was also different with LEORA because we wanted it to be really precise and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16843" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drak-pa</a> kept telling me to re-record samples because we needed to have the phoneme sounds to be really precise and specific. So it was a bit longer. We took like an entire weekend to record the French and I still have to record the English, which will be the hardest part, but I really enjoyed it!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty surprised because LEORA actually has a beautiful high lyrical voice and really beautiful high notes, and I just have recorded a medium voice range, so I&#8217;m kinda confused. I have no idea where they come from, but it&#8217;s cool because it&#8217;s kinda complimentary? I can&#8217;t sing high notes very well and she can sing them for me, which is really cool.</p>

<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/leora.png'><img width="712" height="475" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/leora.png" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/leora.png 712w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/leora-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px" /></a>

<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>What was your first reaction when you heard LEORA for the first time?<br />
</em><br />
<strong>TBK:</strong> Joffrey told me, &#8220;Oh, I can hear your voice in LEORA,&#8221; and I was like, &#8220;Oh, really?&#8221; because I&#8217;m so used to my raw natural voice during the recording process, so it feels completely different for me to hear it through a voice synthesizer. I really don&#8217;t see LEORA as a copy of my voice, really not! I think it&#8217;s a new being, a new entity. It&#8217;s really interesting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>How would you describe the relationship between LEORA and ALYS?<br />
</em><br />
<strong>TBK:</strong> We made LEORA as kind of an &#8220;Alter/Ego,&#8221; if I can say it like that, of <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ALYS</a> so that she can be everything you want her to be! Some people see them as lovers, others as best friends or even enemies. I personally see it as they&#8217;re from the same world, so they&#8217;re just here together. I like all of the things that they can do together?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>And how would you describe YOUR personal relationship with LEORA?<br />
</em><br />
<strong>TBK:</strong> Uhm, that&#8217;s a hard one. I see her like she is a part of me. She&#8217;s everything I can&#8217;t do in public. I like to see her as a warrior, as a berserker, and a strong woman! Sometimes I&#8217;m angry and I can&#8217;t really publicly say, &#8220;I want to destroy it!&#8221; But I feel like LEORA has this attitude where she would say it. I like her; she is my girl, my fighting girl. She&#8217;s our girl with VoxWave and everyone&#8217;s girl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>If you could say something to LEORA in person, what would that be?</em></p>
<p><strong>TBK:</strong> Never give up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>Would you like to perform some day with her side by side?</em></p>
<p><strong>TBK:</strong> Yes, definitely! To be honest, I already asked Joffrey to do a duet song with LEORA because I really think it would be great and, as I said, she has beautiful high notes. So I think I can do the low parts and she can take over the high parts. I really want to try it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>What do you wish for LEORA in the future?</em></p>
<p><strong>TBK:</strong> I hope that people will welcome her just like they did with ALYS. She isn&#8217;t here to replace ALYS; she&#8217;s here to help her! She&#8217;s here to bring forth a new part of their universe. So I really hope people will enjoy LEORA and make songs with her. I just want her to bring something to people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are familiar with the Alter/Ego voice bank &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16811">ALYS</a>,&#8221; then you have most likely heard of <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/51585">LEORA</a>. But if not, let us do a small introduction!</p>
<p>LEORA is <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16810">VoxWave</a>&#8216;s second voice bank and is meant to complement ALYS. Like ALYS, she will be a French virtual singer for the software Alter/Ego. We currently do not have much information on her, but we do know that she is currently in development and that she is voiced by <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16693">TBK</a>.</p>
<p>You can find her voice samples below. Keep in mind that this is only a pre-Alpha version. The song is actually a cover of an ALYS song, and you can find the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWEzDN974fM">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Who is ALYS?</h3>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-58221" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ALYS_Original-1024x724.png" alt="alys_original" width="530" height="375" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ALYS_Original-1024x724.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ALYS_Original-300x212.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ALYS_Original.png 1086w" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px" /></h2>
<p>ALYS is a French and Japanese virtual singer using the software Alter/Ego and is created by VoxWave. She is the first French virtual singer for Alter/Ego and was released on March 10th, 2016. She was voiced by <a href="http://utaitedb.net/Ar/1426">Poucet</a> and illustrated by <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/36035">Saphirya</a>.</p>

<h3>Who is LEORA?</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-58232" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13613384_284225031926792_1096598481407289662_o.jpg" alt="13613384_284225031926792_1096598481407289662_o" width="426" height="602" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13613384_284225031926792_1096598481407289662_o.jpg 679w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13613384_284225031926792_1096598481407289662_o-212x300.jpg 212w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" /></p>
<p>LEORA is VoxWave&#8217;s second voice bank. She is voiced by <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16693">TBK</a> and illustrated by Saphirya. She is still in development.</p>
<p>We hope that this will help us reach out to the French community as well as ensure that we have the most accurate and up-to-date information on both of these virtual singers, both of whom we will be covering from now on.</p>
<p>We look forward to working closely with the French community and VoxWave!</p>
