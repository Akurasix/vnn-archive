										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Bandai&#8217;s <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/66768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirai Komachi</a> was featured in a demonstration of <a href="https://www.criware.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRIWARE</a>&#8216;s ADX LipSync technology at Tokyo Game Show 2019!</p>
<p>Find out more about this exciting technology and how Mirai helped demonstrate it below.</p>
<h2>What is Tokyo Game Show?</h2>
<p>The Tokyo Game Show, also known as TGS, is a video game convention held every September in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makuhari_Messe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Makuhari Messe</a>, in Chiba, Japan.</p>
<p>The first two days are only open to those in the industry, while the public can attend the remaining two days.</p>
<p>TGS is a great opportunity for Japanese and international developers to show off new game releases and related hardware and software.</p>
<p>This year, the event was held from 12th September to 15th September.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-of-the-CRIWARE-Booth-at-TDS.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-244279 size-medium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-of-the-CRIWARE-Booth-at-TDS-300x200.jpg" alt="Photo of the CRIWARE Booth at TGS" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-of-the-CRIWARE-Booth-at-TDS-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Photo-of-the-CRIWARE-Booth-at-TDS.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h2>What is ADX LipSync?</h2>
<p>ADX LipSync is a voice analysis and lip syncing software which automatically generates natural mouth movements on a 3D model based on voice data.</p>
<p>The voice analysis technology chooses the optimal mouth movements based on deep learning and then generates those movements in real time.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mirai-demonstrating-ADX-LipSync.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-244305 size-medium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mirai-demonstrating-ADX-LipSync-300x279.jpg" alt="Mirai demonstrating ADX LipSync" width="300" height="279" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mirai-demonstrating-ADX-LipSync-300x279.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mirai-demonstrating-ADX-LipSync-800x743.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mirai-demonstrating-ADX-LipSync.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>In typical game development, animators must adjust the mouth shape manually for each character based on the volume, tone etc.</p>
<p>Of course, this can be a very time consuming task! ADX LipSync has been developed as a response to this issue in an attempt to reduce development times.</p>
<p>At Tokyo Game Show, attendees could simply talk into a microphone and then watch as Mirai moved her mouth in real time with their speech.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Attendee-testing-ADX-LipSync.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-244292 size-medium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Attendee-testing-ADX-LipSync-300x200.jpg" alt="Attendee testing ADX LipSync" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Attendee-testing-ADX-LipSync-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Attendee-testing-ADX-LipSync.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>According to CRIWARE, the response from attendees at the event was quite positive! Developers could not wait to start using the technology themselves!</p>
<p>As well as interest from game developers, there was also an interest in utilizing the technology for the V-tuber community.</p>

<p>On top of that, a video was also published on &#8220;VRonWEBMEDIA Official channel&#8221; showcasing real-time character animation of BanaCAST at SIGGRAPH Asia 2018! In the video, you can see her model being controlled in real time by a motion capture device during this 9 minute demonstration.  This is pretty cool to watch, especially for those who are not entirely familiar with this form of technology! Could we see Mirai Komachi becoming a Virtual YouTuber in the future? Who knows! </p>
