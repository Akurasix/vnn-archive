										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the success of our November themed submissions featuring DEX &amp; DAINA, we&#8217;ve decided to continue with the monthly themes! This time with a bit more notice. Fans will have all of December to create any art (from songs to illustrations and cosplay, to whatever comes to your mind) and submit it to VNN for a chance to be featured!</p>
<h3>December Submissions Theme</h3>
<p>This month&#8217;s theme is two parts; you can combine the two parts or do it separately. Our theme is &#8220;December Birthdays&#8221; and &#8220;Winter Holidays!&#8221; Due to the vast amount of December birthdays, there&#8217;s no way we could hold an event for every individual. So instead, we&#8217;re grouping them all together! In addition, you can also create works themed on winter holidays. Everything from Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa, to the New Year and anything else you may celebrate! As mentioned before, you don&#8217;t have to combine the two. If you want to just draw a picture of the Kagamines without the winter holiday theme, that&#8217;s perfectly fine.</p>
<h5>December Birthdays</h5>
<p>As we said, there are a TON of December birthdays. So we&#8217;ll list them all here for fans to easily access.</p>
<p><a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/146" target="_blank">SF-A2 miki</a> (December 4th)<br />

<h3>Submission Rules</h3>
<p>As always, the <a href="/fan-submission-guidelines/" target="_blank">original submission rules</a> apply. However, in addition to these rules, we have one extra request this time around.</p>
<p>Please have all works be original.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to create a brand new work just for the fan submissions though! Any of your original work no matter how old it is, will be accepted. We just ask that no song covers be entered this time around as we&#8217;re looking for unique, new content to feature.</p>
<p>Your work does not have to be winter holiday themed. however, Any original song featuring one or more of the December birthday VOCALOIDs works just as well as an original song themed around the holidays. Take your pick and have fun!</p>
<p>Submissions are due by December 24th, 11:59 PM (23:59) GMT.</p>
<h3>Extra Note</h3>
<p>Please <strong>do NOT</strong> directly upload your works to Facebook messenger and send them to us via Facebook page messages. It ruins the quality and makes it more difficult to properly credit you. Please upload your work somewhere public that will keep the resolution. We suggest either DeviantArt or Pixiv. Once you upload it, you can send us the link however you&#8217;d like.</p>
<p>If you would rather send us the picture and not have it uploaded, please email us at contact@vocaloidnews.net.</p>
