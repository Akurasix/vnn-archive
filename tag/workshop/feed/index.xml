										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve already wrote about the release of the book &#8220;<a href="/learn-japanese-language-culture-with-miku-de-nihongo-book/">Miku dé Nihongo</a>&#8221; a month ago, which gained quite some popularity since then. Those who weren&#8217;t able to take a look at it yet, will be happy to hear that the book will be reviewed and used as a part of the workshop &#8220;&#8216;Dojin&#8217; means kindered spirits&#8221; at the german convention CosDay² 2018 in Frankfurt, Germany.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="de" dir="ltr">?&#x200d;? Was ist eigentlich ein &quot;Dojin&quot;-Event? Wer sich das schon gefragt hat, wird auf dem CosDay² mit zwei Workshops rund um das Thema ausführliche Informationen erhalten:<a href="https://t.co/dqNx0e2kiD">https://t.co/dqNx0e2kiD</a> <a href="https://t.co/dqNx0e2kiD">https://t.co/dqNx0e2kiD</a></p>
<p>&mdash; CosDay (@CosDay) <a href="https://twitter.com/CosDay/status/1014502122946211840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The workshop is divided into two parts and gives a brief glimpse into the world of Dojin events. <a href="https://twitter.com/ginjake">Ginjake</a>, who was part of quite some VOCALOID Dojin Events in the past will talk about his experiences as an organizer with such events with the help of Yoichi Sakai as interpreter on Saturday. After that, Yoichi Sakai will host a Japanese language course using and presenting &#8220;Miku dé Nihongo&#8221;.</p>
<h3>Workshop 1: &#8220;Dojin&#8221; Events in Japan from the Point of View of an Organizer</h3>
<p>&#8220;Dojin&#8221; is the japanese word for &#8220;kindered spirits&#8221;. There are so-called &#8220;Dojin&#8221; markets, including some with the idea of &#8220;only events&#8221; where visitors will find Dojin products only to a specific topic! This concept is quite popular in Japan. The Japanese organizer &#8220;Ginjake&#8221; will give insights and tips for visiting such events by taking the example of Yuzuki Yukari.</p>
<p>On top of that, you&#8217;ll be able to grab some of these &#8220;Dojin&#8221; products at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, July 21st 2018<br />
<strong>Time</strong>: 1:00 PM ~ 2:00 PM (CEST)<br />
<strong>Room</strong>: Workshop Room 1</p>

<h3>Workshop 2: Japanese for &#8220;Dojin&#8221; Events</h3>
<p>You are at a &#8220;Dojin&#8221; event in Japan and want to talk with Japanese fellows? But how are you supposed to communicate with them? This workshop teaches typical phrases when talking about so-called &#8220;Otaku&#8221; stuff. Beginners are welcome, no prior knowledge in Japanese required, but participants will have to take part of a role play.</p>
<p>Additionally, they will present you the Japanese learning book &#8220;Miku dé Nihongo&#8221; thanks to the help of Sanshusha (三修社).</p>
<p><strong>Date</strong>: Sunday, July 22nd 2018<br />
<strong>Time</strong>: 10:45 AM ~ 11:45 AM (CEST)<br />
<strong>Room</strong>: Workshop Room  2</p>
