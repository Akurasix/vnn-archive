										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>VNN&#8217;s German division was able to attend Dokomi this year. Luckily, we were also able to interview <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/2733" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BIGHEAD</a> who attended Dokomi, with TANAKA who wrote the lyrics for their well known song &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/66126" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharing the World</a>&#8220;, for the Miku Expo 2014! Unfortunately, during the convention, the Dokomi interpreter didn&#8217;t have much time, so we were only able to ask a few questions. Due to time issues, part of the interview was conducted in person while the other was by email. However, please enjoy our full interview with BIGHEAD!<br />
<em>Note: The interview was conducted in Japanese. While we try to keep our translations as accurate as possible, not everything translates perfectly.<br />
</em></p>
<h3>The Interview</h3>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>First, thank you BIGHEAD for your time. It&#8217;s really nice to welcome you here in Germany! So how was Germany and Dokomi? Would you like to come to Europe again?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> At Dokomi, everything was perfect. Everyone there was enjoying the event with a fresh feeling. It made me feel that animation, manga and cosplay are advancing their own evolution rather than following Japan.</p>
<p>Unlike Paris and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nice</a>, which I visited last year, the deep clouds and the beautiful cityscape here have given me some inspiration. I think that I&#8217;ll also be able to create new songs influenced by my experiences in Germany. I&#8217;d like to come back to Europe soon.</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>That&#8217;s nice to hear! So I guess we could start with our actual interview if you don&#8217;t mind. So how did you discover VOCALOID at first?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> I&#8217;ve seen this Google ad, the &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/8395" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tell Your World</a>&#8221; video and was very moved by it.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MGt25mv4-2Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>It&#8217;s well known today, isn&#8217;t it? Did you have any experience in writing music prior to VOCALOID?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> I&#8217;ve been playing in a band since my days in school, high school, that is, and recorded stuff in a recording studio later on.</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>Which instrument did you play? Do you still play it?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> At the start, I played the guitar, then the bass, and in my college days, I was playing the drums all the time. When making songs with <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hatsune Miku</a>, I still record the bass and guitar by myself, and my drumming experience is useful when programming drums. My past involvement with music is certainly helping.</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>Only after being in VOCALOID and producing for some time, did you change your producer name to BIGHEAD. Where does this alias come from and what does it mean?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> The person I love has a rather big head &#8211; and that&#8217;s where &#8220;BIGHEAD&#8221; came from.</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>Haha, that&#8217;s a lovely choice! So, what we were also wondering, unlike other Japanese producers, you write a lot of English songs. What inspired you to write mainly songs with English lyrics?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> There was a &#8220;Western Music Boom&#8221; during the time I was in high school. I&#8217;ve listened to nothing but Western Music, so I wanted to make stuff like that. I thought that it would be good and common.</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>And you are indeed appreciated in the west for your work! A lot of Spanish-speaking people love the Spanish version of &#8220;Sharing the World&#8221;. What do you think about it, and about how other songs are translated into different languages?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> I&#8217;m honored that &#8220;Sharing The World&#8221; is played in various countries, but it is surprising that it has been covered in Spanish, Chinese, and even more languages! I receive a lot of emails every month saying &#8220;Please release this&#8221; from Mexican fans.  I hope that &#8220;Sharing The World&#8221; will continue to expand all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>You&#8217;ve used <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/958" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miku&#8217;s English V3</a> and her <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/49724" target="_blank" rel="noopener">English V4</a>. Which do you think is better, V3 or V4?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> For Japanese, V2 is Number 1. After that, I use V4 frequently. With V4, I think that the possibilities of expression and choices are expanded. As for English, I like V3 in the part of pronunciation and rhythm, so I mainly use v3.</p>
<p>I was planning to say that at the Dokomi workshop, that it is effective to use V3 and V4 in combination for harmony parts. I wanted to tell everyone more, but, in the workshop, there were a lot of enthusiastic questions and it was so exciting I couldn&#8217;t fit everything in.</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>Are you planning on using other VOCALOIDs in the future?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> I&#8217;ve met Joffrey from <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this French company</a> here at Dokomi, so I decided to make something, and he and I can work on it together.</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>What do you think about the VOCALOID characters and their personalities? Is it the composer who makes their personality? And for the composer, who is part of the fandom, will public opinion of the fandom form the composer&#8217;s opinion on a character?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> I do not think that VOCALOIDs themselves have personalities. VOCALOIDs are colorless and transparent, so composers and listeners can self-project. But the composer cannot make the personality of a VOCALOID, because the personality of VOCALOID is by everyone. I like how that part is hard and can not be handled. However, it isn&#8217;t difficult to share VOCALOID content. By using VOCALOID, &#8220;Sharing The World&#8221; becomes easy!</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>How was it to cooperate with other artists when making <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/150365">&#8220;OISHII&#8221; TRIP</a>?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> Composer <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/57113">Oguro</a> and lyricist <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/57112">Aoyama</a> have profound knowledge about VOCALOID, so we were able to produce smoothly. I have enjoyed it thanks to the experience collaborating with <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/2434">EmpathP</a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/919">CircusP</a> and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/25588">ROBO</a> for the first time. Also, this time I was very happy that customers shook hands and raised their voices when playing &#8220;OISHII&#8221; TRIP at Dokomi&#8217;s DJ event.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZuAiTiExIPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>Do you have any advice for fans who are getting started in producing and are becoming successful?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> After about a year after I started making VOCALOID songs, my first song was selected for a Lady Gaga concert. You never know what can happen, so if you happen to come across a huge chance like that, have the courage to meet the challenge.</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>Is there anything else you would like to say to your fans?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> I like to take part in events like Dokomi and want to communicate with people from all over the world, so I&#8217;d like to thank all the people I&#8217;ve met in this country.</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>Thank you for your time! Hopefully we&#8217;ll see you again soon in Europe and have fun at Anime Next!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, VNN is more than just our main news site, as we have a few other branches under the VNN name. One of them is ProjectDIVA.net and ProjectDIVA.wiki. Originally, these sites were as they implied, meant for <em>Project Diva</em>. However, we felt that by focusing only on one game series with the increasing amount of rhythm games featuring VOCALOIDs out there, the most recent being <em><a href="/zyon/">Zyon</a></em>, it seemed like we were limiting ourselves. With that said, we have decided to start another project that would focus on all rhythm games featuring VOCALOIDs such as <em>Zyon</em>, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groove_Coaster">Groove Coaster</a></em>, <em><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.teamegg.beatandmagicians&amp;hl=en">Bemagi</a>,</em> and more.</p>
<h3><a href="https://projectdiva.net/community/">ProjectDIVA.net</a></h3>
<p>ProjectDIVA.net is a forum that was meant for <em>Project Diva</em> games originally.</p>
<h4>Whats New?</h4>
<p>Recently, we have made several changes to the website.</p>
<p>First, we have added several games to the list. The games that we have added are <em>Zyon</em>, <em><a href="http://dynamix.c4-cat.com/">Dynamix</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.rayark.com/g/voez/">Voez</a></em>, <em>Bemagi/Beat &amp; Magicians</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_Girls_Festival"><em>Miracle</em> <em>Girls Festival</em></a>, and <em>Groove Coaster</em>. We also have other games on there such as <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IA/VT_Colorful">IA/VT Colorful</a></em></strong>, <em><a href="http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/Megpoid_the_Music%E2%99%AF">Megpoid the Music</a>,</em> and <em><a href="http://nisamerica.com/games/blackrockshooterthegame/">Black★Rock Shooter: The Game</a></em>.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/games.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-105463" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/games.png" alt="" width="541" height="607" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/games.png 829w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/games-267x300.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" /></a></p>
<p>Second, we have made some updates to the main graphics of the site as well as changed the logo and slogan from &#8220;The projectDIVA community&#8221; to &#8220;Your Board for VOCALOID Rhythm games.&#8221; This was to better represent the new changes as well as the beginning of our new project.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/forums-banner-thing.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-105476" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/forums-banner-thing-1024x153.png" alt="" width="618" height="92" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/forums-banner-thing-1024x153.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/forums-banner-thing-300x45.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/forums-banner-thing.png 1841w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a></p>
<p>Last but not least, we have also opened up our Projectdiva.net <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ProjectDIVA.net/photos/a.1603558739962772.1073741827.1589111618074151/1830710213914289/?type=1&amp;theater">Facebook page</a> so that we can post VOCALOID rhythm game news, videos, and more!

<p><em>Note: We must approve all members to join in order to eliminate spam. Therefore, if you can&#8217;t post right away, give us up to 24 hours in order to check it.</em></p>
<p>We also have a section under &#8220;<a href="https://projectdiva.net/community/forums/international-forums.76/">International forums</a>&#8221; that is meant for other languages. At the moment, we have every language that is available on VNN. If you would like your language to be added, simply send us a message and we will add it for you.</p>
<p>Many more updates to come in the future, so stay tuned!</p>
<h3><a href="http://projectdiva.wiki/">ProjectDIVA.wiki</a></h3>
<p>The ProjectDIVA.wiki is just as it sounds, a wiki for the games where you can find the song list, achievements, modules, and more.</p>
<h4>Whats New?</h4>
<p>First, we have made some changes to the navigation system in order to make things less cluttered and easier to navigate. We are also working on adding all of the games mentioned above. However, in the meantime, you can still find plenty of information on the ones already set up.</p>
<p>Second, we also have a <a href="https://discord.gg/aa578Mm">Discord</a> for people who wish to talk about the games through chat, compare scores, ask questions, or just meet people in general. We have many channels set up for different languages and discussions.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/discord.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-105489" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/discord-1024x540.png" alt="" width="519" height="274" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/discord-1024x540.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/discord-300x158.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/discord-310x165.png 310w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/discord.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px" /></a></p>
<p>This is only the beginning of what is to come for this project, so you can expect much more to come in the future!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As mentioned <a href="/vnn-at-hanami-and-anime-north/">previously</a>, I (Cinzya from our German team) spent a lot of time at the German convention, <a href="https://hanami-ludwigshafen.de/">Hanami</a>, in Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Rhineland-Palatinate, at the Pfalzbau some weeks ago. This was the first time for VNN to attend a convention in Germany, so we wanted to check how active the German VOCALOID community actually is and what we would see there and at future German cons. There weren&#8217;t a lot of VOCALOID related events at Hanami, but since Maido no Kisetsu once more made an appearance with their <em>Sailor Moon</em> themed café there, I took the opportunity to check it out for you to see what we may expect for <a href="/vocalnexus-x-maido-no-kisetsu-collaboration/">the upcoming VOCALOID themed café</a>, which will also be organized by them with the help of our partners, VocalNexus.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not to mention, this was a good opportunity to showcase our brand-new VNN shirt!</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">What is Hanami?</h2>
<figure id="attachment_102088" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-102088" style="width: 204px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-102088" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kurt-die-kirschblüte-300x225-300x225.png" alt="" width="204" height="153" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-102088" class="wp-caption-text">Kurt the cherry blossom, mascot of Hanami.</figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;Hanami&#8221; (Jap. <span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">花見</span>, &#8220;flower viewing&#8221;) is the Japanese traditional custom of enjoying the transient beauty of flowers. In this case, flowers (&#8220;hana&#8221;) are almost always referring to those of the cherry (&#8220;sakura&#8221;) trees or, less frequently, plum (&#8220;ume&#8221;) trees.</p>
<p>The so-called German event Hanami, short for &#8220;Hanami &#8211; Con meets Festival,&#8221; is based on this tradition and invites fans of Japanese culture, comics (&#8220;manga&#8221;), and animation (&#8220;anime&#8221;) to meet during this two-day convention. This annual anime convention has been organized by voluntary fans with the help of <a href="http://animexx.onlinewelten.com/">Animexx e.V. </a> since 2006 in Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Besides performances of classical aspects of Japanese culture like taiko drums, performances in various martial arts and introductory courses in, for example, the grooming of bonsai trees or origami art, shape the colourful modern world of their &#8220;hanami.&#8221; Especially noticeable is cosplay, to which they dedicate countless competitions, workshops, and shows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">VocalNexus</h2>
<figure id="attachment_101918" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-101918" style="width: 618px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Hanami17_VocalNexus.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-101918 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Hanami17_VocalNexus-1024x919.jpg" alt="" width="618" height="555" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Hanami17_VocalNexus-1024x919.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Hanami17_VocalNexus-300x269.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-101918" class="wp-caption-text">VocalNexus&#8217; booth together with their partner and photographer, Railgun.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Our partners VocalNexus were present with a booth as well. While it was also VocalNexus&#8217; first time at Hanami, they used their chance to promote their projects. Fans had the opportunity to take a glimpse into Freaky Lulu&#8217;s playlist, and listen to some VOCALOID music and some VOCAMERICA clips. You even had the chance to request your favourite VOCALOID song for the next radio broadcast at their radio show at <a href="https://kibo.fm/">Kibo.FM</a>, but if you didn&#8217;t realize this or got to the con, don&#8217;t fret! You can still request a song before or during VocalNexus&#8217; future broadcasts on Sundays at 8 PM~10 PM <span class="_Hq"> (MESZ). Please note that VocalNexus&#8217; show and Kibo&#8217;s page are currently only available in German.</span></p>
<h2>Maid Café</h2>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Maido-no-Kisetsu_VOCALOID-cafe.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-102050" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Maido-no-Kisetsu_VOCALOID-cafe-724x1024.jpg" alt="" width="286" height="404" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Maido-no-Kisetsu_VOCALOID-cafe-724x1024.jpg 724w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Maido-no-Kisetsu_VOCALOID-cafe-212x300.jpg 212w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Maido-no-Kisetsu_VOCALOID-cafe.jpg 1448w" sizes="(max-width: 286px) 100vw, 286px" /></a>One of VocalNexus&#8217; upcoming projects is the Crypton VOCALOID collaboration maid café with <a href="http://www.maido-no-kisetsu.com/">Maido no Kisetsu</a>, a group of volunteers organizing maid cafés for German cons, such as Hanami. This year, Maido no Kisetsu again hosted their <em>Sailor Moon</em> themed café in collaboration with <a href="http://www.sailormoongerman.com/">SailorMoonGerman</a>.</p>
<p>Even though it was not directly VOCALOID related, I dropped by and got in touch with VocalNexus to get some info of what we&#8217;ll get for the VOCALOID café in August at <a href="https://animagic.animania.de/">AnimagiC 2017</a>!</p>
<p>The maid café wasn&#8217;t that different from other ordinary maid cafés. What made it so special for the visitors to wait hours in line to get in were the <em>Sailor Moon</em> themed snacks, drinks, and (of course) the cute maids dressed as the Sailor Scouts. The whole location was <em>Sailor Moon</em> themed with decorations, and every table was dedicated to a <em>Sailor Moon</em> character. Besides the normal drinks and food, guests were able to choose from special themed drinks of Sailor Pluto, Sailor Chibi, Sailor Uranus, and Sailor Neptune, as well as several &#8220;Sailor cupcakes.&#8221; Angelina Paustian, who recently released her newest cookbook <em><a href="http://mangakueche.de/en/product-126.html">Manga Kochbuch Kawaii</a></em>, created the dishes. Freaky Lulu from VocalNexus, Railgun, and I took the opportunity to taste some of the drinks and were thrilled by their taste. While we enjoyed our drinks, I got into a short conversation with Freaky Lulu about their plans for the VOCALOID café.</p>
<p><strong>Cinzya:</strong> These drinks are really good! Will we get similar ones for AnimagiC as well?</p>
<p><strong>Freaky Lulu:</strong> Of course! Angelina Paustian will provide recipes for our VOCALOID café as well. We want to offer special drinks of all the Crypton VOCALOIDs, but it will depend on Angelina for what she&#8217;ll come up with.</p>
<p><strong>Cinzya:</strong> So the café won&#8217;t be only Miku-orientated?</p>
<p><strong>Freaky Lulu:</strong> It may appear so, but every Crypton VOCALOD will be covered! This year is special because of Hatsune Miku&#8217;s and Kagamine Rin &amp; Len&#8217;s 10th birthdays, so it&#8217;s dedicated to them, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it will be only centered around them! Since the location we will get at AnimagiC is pretty huge, we are planning to decorate separate corners with different Cryptonloid themes. So if you are fed up of Miku, you can simply chill at the Luka corner while being surrounded by her beauty, for example! Our great freelance artist, MiYuki, is hard at work illustrating our images!</p>
<p><strong>Cinzya:</strong> That sounds great!</p>
<p><strong>Freaky Lulu:</strong> Yes, we are all thrilled! To get the fandom more involved into our project, we also want to gather artwork of the Crypton VOCALOIDs from fans and offer some prices for our submissions! But I will announce more information about it soon!</p>
<p><strong>Cinzya:</strong> We&#8217;re looking forward to it!</p>

<h2>Cosplay</h2>
<p>Anime conventions aren&#8217;t complete without cosplay! Although I saw many amazing cosplayers wearing costumes from anime and of game characters, there weren&#8217;t as many VOCALOID ones. This is because Hanami is more anime-oriented. However, I was able to find several amazing VOCALOID cosplayers brimming with confidence. Check out the photos below!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our Spanish section has been open for some time now, however, we felt that we could bring even more to our Spanish-speaking community due to being a very big fandom in numbers. Therefore, in order to improve the speed at which we can bring our translations to the Spanish-speaking fandom, we have decided to work with the HolaMiku team based in Mexico! We hope that from now on, our Spanish-speaking fans will be able to enjoy news and articles quicker than before.</p>
<p>HolaMiku is currently a Facebook page run by a group of several VOCALOID fans from Mexico and now will also be members of VNN!</p>
<p>If you would like to follow HolaMiku, you can find them on their social media below.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/HolaMikuMX/">Facebook</a><br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/HolaMiku">Twitter</a></p>
<p>We hope to keep improving VNN across all our languages and platforms even more as time goes, so stay tuned for more!</p>
<p>Special thanks to our new member from the Spanish team Hibarinrinrin for the featured image!</p>

<p>For those of you who have been following us for a while, you may remember that I (Monds) was at <a href="http://www.animenorth.com/live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anime North</a> last year where Asami Shimoda, the voice provider of Rin and Len, was in attendance. I also had the opportunity to ask her some questions. You can find more information on this <a href="/vocaloid-news-network-at-anime-north-2016-and-qa-with-asami-shimoda/">here</a>. I am happy to announce that I will be attending Anime North again! This time, however, I will not be doing a panel, but I will still bring along pins to give away. So if you see me around in my VNN shirt, make sure to stop me and get yours!</p>
