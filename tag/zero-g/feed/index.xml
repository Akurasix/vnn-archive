										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little over 24 hours ago, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/201" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero-G</a> posted on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zerog.audio.samples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook page</a> asking for suggestions for new libraries. While the initial response was rather slow, the post suddenly exploded today with quite the request! In addition to asking for a new VOCALOID and various other updates, fans were in huge support of <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/388" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miriam</a> receiving an upgrade.</p>

<h3>The Facts</h3>
<p>While fans are hyped about Miriam V4, there are a few things to remember. Despite the human Miriam being ready to record and Zero-G&#8217;s social media staff saying they&#8217;ll pass on the message, there&#8217;s no guarantee. While fans have shown their interest, Miriam was an expensive VOCALOID to make. Depending on the cost, Zero-G may not find it feasible to update.</p>
<p>However, they&#8217;ve definitely acknowledged the demand! While they haven&#8217;t promised she&#8217;ll happen, they have noted that Miriam V4 would make a lot of fans happy. While other VOCALOIDs were requested for updates, Miriam was noted to be the &#8220;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/zerog.audio.samples/posts/1443294925750619?comment_id=1446213105458801&amp;reply_comment_id=1446237075456404&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firm favorite</a>&#8221; by Zero-G social media.</p>
<p>Miriam is currently unavailable due to lack of serial codes. As a V1, she was discontinued quite some time ago. And because no new codes have been generated, she could no longer be sold once the codes that did exist were used. This unfortunately left fans unable to obtain her. However, an update would solve this problem and provide fans with an updated voice bank.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/54512c2570.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-123642" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/54512c2570.png" alt="" width="515" height="158" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/54512c2570.png 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/54512c2570-300x92.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.vocaloidotaku.net/index.php?/topic/63660-vocaloid-miriam-now-completely-unavailable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, as previously mentioned, there&#8217;s a lot that would go into updating Miriam. There&#8217;s no promise that it will happen even with Miriam Stockley being in support of the update.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks for all the Vocaloid support! If enough of you write in to Zero-G, maybe we can get a happening, up-to-date version out there! ??<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>&mdash; Miriam Stockley (@miriamstockley) <a href="https://twitter.com/miriamstockley/status/893220089226555392">August 3, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As some fans may remember, she noted she&#8217;d love to do an update all the way back in 2015.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">So sorry &#8211; didn&#39;t see this until today. <br />I&#39;d love to do an updated version of Vocaloid. The technology has come on in leaps &amp; bounds. ?</p>
<p>&mdash; Miriam Stockley (@miriamstockley) <a href="https://twitter.com/miriamstockley/status/579697928022974464">March 22, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Fans were excited for a VOCALOID Miriam update back then as well. However, it has yet to happen. Only time will tell if, with the interest expressed by fans, Zero-G will decide to update the VOCALOID Miriam voice bank. Hopefully they will, though!</p>
<h3>Other Suggestions</h3>
<p>Fans also suggested updates of <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/390" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tonio</a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/386" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LEON</a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/387" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LOLA</a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/389" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prima</a>, and even <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/200" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SONiKA</a>. They also requested completely new additions to Zero-G&#8217;s VOCALOID libraries. Some fans requested the previously mentioned male rock vocal while others requested a mature pop vocal.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>While fans definitely made it clear that they want Miriam V4, there&#8217;s no promise. Unfortunately, the company can only do so much. Even with there being demand, there is a chance she won&#8217;t happen. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that fans should lose hope! No matter what, continue to support VOCALOID companies so that they can continue to make VOCALOID products that you can fall in love with! No matter what Zero-G does next, it&#8217;s definitely going to be great.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After much anticipation, the VOCALOID 4 voice banks <a href="https://www.zero-g.co.uk/store/vocaloid4-dex-p544.php" target="_blank">Dex</a> and <a href="https://www.zero-g.co.uk/store/vocaloid4-daina-p545.php" target="_blank">Daina</a> are now available for purchase from Zero-G! At the moment, it appears they aren&#8217;t available in Zero-G&#8217;s VOCALOID listings but the urls to the purchase pages are available. In addition to the product release, we now know the box art designs for the characters.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;DEX and DAINA are Zero-G’s newest Vocaloid voice banks and are our most emotive and expressive virtual vocalists to date. Much care has been taken with their development to create realistic and unique sounding voicebanks. They are set apart from previous releases due to both their American accents and their diverse vocal characteristics.&#8221; — <strong>Zero-G</strong></p></blockquote>

<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Dex.jpg'><img width="618" height="936" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Dex-676x1024.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Dex-676x1024.jpg 676w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Dex-198x300.jpg 198w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Dex.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a>
<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Daina.jpg'><img width="618" height="936" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Daina-676x1024.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Daina-676x1024.jpg 676w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Daina-198x300.jpg 198w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Daina.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a>

<p>Just like EmpathP mentioned in <a href="https://rayduxz.cl/vnn/en/dex-and-daina-live-stream-summary/" target="_blank">one of her live streams</a>, there are design changes that help market the newest English VOCALOIDs to a more professional crowd. However, the designs haven&#8217;t changed too much.</p>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
<p>Both Dex and Daina will go for $69.99 USD when they aren&#8217;t on sale. However, as a special introductory offer, each voice bank can be purchased for $49.99 USD at the moment.</p>
<p>In addition, there <strong>is</strong> a bundling option. When you have both Dex and Daina in your cart, a discount will automatically be applied and you will be able to purchase the two for $89.99.</p>
<h3>Demos</h3>
<p>The release of VOCALOIDs Dex and Daina also brings several demos with them. Those who created demo songs with these VOCALOIDs were asked to refrain from posting full versions of the songs until Dex and Daina&#8217;s release. While some demos songs have remained the same length, others have had more added to them. Some of these are brand new or were only previously teased in live streams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, we received an update on English VOCALOIDs Dex and Daina via a live stream hosted by <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/2434" target="_blank">EmpathP</a> and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/9940" target="_blank">Kenji-B</a>. As many pointed out, the two voice banks were supposed to be released in the summer of 2015. However, due to difficulty communicating with YAMAHA, there has been a delay. This is very common with English VOCALOIDs and no one should worry.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the stream was taken down due to the chat being filled with vulgar comments. However, EmpathP was kind enough to post <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vocaloidproducerempathp/posts/582712885201386" target="_blank">a summary of the stream</a> on her page.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2056" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2056" style="width: 294px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Dex.png"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2056 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Dex-294x1024.png" alt="" width="294" height="1024" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2056" class="wp-caption-text">Art by SteelEmissary</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Packaging and Pricing</h3>
<p>Dex and Daina will have both a physical release and a digital download. At the moment, EmpathP and Kenji-B have yet to hear whether the voice banks will be bundled for physical purchase.</p>
<p>The digital release <strong>will </strong>have the voice banks downloadable separately. There is a possibility of there being a discount if both are purchased but nothing has been confirmed yet.</p>
<p>The final artwork has yet to be announced. Though the character designs are likely to stay the same, there is no box art available at this time.</p>
<p>In regards to price, everyone who worked on Dex and Daina are confident that they will be affordable. EmpathP suggests that the two banks will likely cost about $70 USD each. However, an official price has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<h3>The Delay</h3>
<p>As mentioned in the opening paragraph, Dex and Daina were slated for a release in the summer. However, due to slow communications, things haven&#8217;t been as fast as fans would like. EmpathP says not to worry, however:</p>
<blockquote><p>In regards to their delay, we deeply apologize for that, but again, it&#8217;s just continued difficulty in communication with Yamaha. I know that&#8217;s not what you guys wish to hear, but it is a fact that English Vocaloids are RARELY (if ever) able to give an EXACT date for release, as often times EVERYTHING is left pending until Yamaha replies back to correspondence. it&#8217;s no fault of their own, there&#8217;s many factors going into this (time differences, language barriers, ect.)</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Kenji-B&#8217;s <a href="http://www.vocaloidotaku.net/index.php?/topic/60706-dex-and-daina-two-new-vocaloids-from-zero-g/page__view__findpost__p__1303082" target="_blank">post on Vocaloid Otaku</a>, they&#8217;re hoping that the banks will be released by the end of October.</p>
<p>EmpathP promises that she will keep fans informed. She&#8217;ll be posting information as soon as she can and encourages fans to stay positive even if Dex and Daina are delayed for any reason.</p>

<h3>Voice Types and Information</h3>
<p>Dex and Daina have very different voice types, <a href="https://rayduxz.cl/vocaloid/en/2015/06/21/dex-and-daina-revealed/" target="_blank">as mentioned before</a> in the live stream that announced the duo.</p>
<p>Dex is a powerful vocal that is said to be easy to manipulate for multiple styles. Though he and Daina are both marketed as Pop vocals, Dex can easily perform Rock and even ballads.</p>
<p>Daina is seen as a type of mirror to Dex&#8217;s powerful voice. She&#8217;s breathier and huskier and can even sound soulful at times. Her breathy voice is very different from Avanna however, according to EmpathP.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also been stated that Daina has a bit of a Southern &#8220;twang&#8221; that could be used to create Country music.</p>
<p>Avanna is also breathy but leans more on the side of soft and elegant while Daina is more assertive in her pronunciation.</p>
<p>EmpathP also talked about how Dex and Daina will work well together as well as how Daina will be able to do duets with many stronger vocals.</p>
<blockquote><p>Together Dex and Daina create a marvelous balance, with Dex emphasizing Daina&#8217;s more sombre tone, and Daina reigning back Dex&#8217;s Power when needed. These two are going to be EXCELLENT duets (and I predict that those who purchase them will feel the same way). We also discussed how, due to Daina&#8217;s more soulful voice, she will be marvelous in duets with other more power-house vocals such as Ruby, Big-Al, ect.</p></blockquote>
<p>The two will <strong>not </strong>be XSY compatible in the beginning. They may be given more voice banks in the future if they sell well.</p>
<p>They will, however, have Growl capabilities. EmpathP has stated she doesn&#8217;t particularly like their growls but admits she&#8217;s likely biased due to her general dislike of the Growl feature.</p>
<h5>Demos</h5>
<p>As soon as Dex and Daina are released, Kenji-B will release a song featuring them. At the moment, there are a few demos for Dex and one for Daina. Most were shown in the first live stream but there are now several demos uploaded to EmpathP&#8217;s and Kenji-B&#8217;s YouTube and SoundCloud accounts.</p>
<p><strong>DAINA</strong></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DUGLW8koaJs" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>DEX</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/nostraightanswer/respire-feat-dex-vocaloid-original-song-sample">https://soundcloud.com/nostraightanswer/respire-feat-dex-vocaloid-original-song-sample</a></p>
<p><strong>BOTH</strong></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F228231182&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=618&#038;maxheight=927"></iframe></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F228232018&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=618&#038;maxheight=927"></iframe></p>
<h3>New American English Phonemes</h3>
<p>EmpathP explains the different new phonemes in her post. These phonemes are available for <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/25258" target="_blank">Ruby</a> as well.</p>
<p><strong>[4]</strong> Creates a subtle &#8220;t&#8221; or &#8220;d&#8221; sound for use in words such as &#8220;better&#8221;, &#8220;getting&#8221;, ect.)<br />
<strong>[e@0]</strong> Is an American &#8220;a&#8221; sound which can be used in place of the phoneme <strong>[{]</strong> for words like &#8220;than&#8221;, &#8220;land&#8221;, &#8220;hand&#8221;, ect.)<br />
<strong>[h&#093;</strong> Was previously used as a breath sound, but with Dex, Daina, and Ruby, they have on-pitch, TUNED <strong>[h&#093;</strong> which can be used in the place of a regular <strong>[h]</strong> if for whatever reason it is causing a harsh sound).</p>
<p>These phonemes are made to emphasize the American accent. The previous script was made to emphasize the British accent.</p>
<p>At the moment, there&#8217;s no plan for a dictionary to be part of the software. Kenji-B does plan to make his own dictionary for those who need it and EmpathP stated that she wants to do tutorials to teach people how to tune English VOCALOIDs.</p>
<h3>Supporting English VOCALOIDs</h3>
<figure id="attachment_2081" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/flufferpuffer_by_akiglancy-d8yaus3.png"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2081 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/flufferpuffer_by_akiglancy-d8yaus3.png" alt="" width="1000" height="638" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2081" class="wp-caption-text">Art by AkiGlancy/EmpathP</figcaption></figure>
<p>Though this topic isn&#8217;t just for Dex and Daina, it&#8217;s just as important as the information on them. EmpathP has stressed that supporting English VOCALOIDs is <strong>very</strong> important. Here is the quote from EmpathP&#8217;s post:</p>
<blockquote><p>I talked about why it is paramount that we show support to each company who produces English VOCALOIDs.</p>
<p>I realize there are still a lot of sore and betrayed feelings with recent releases. I especially realize that not everyone is happy with the companies and how they choose to promote (or not promote) their software. But I encourage each and every one of you to please try to be kind and supportive of the software releases for what they are.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is English VOCALOIDs do <strong>NOT</strong> sell like the Japanese ones. It&#8217;s a gamble every single time these companies invest in this software. I don&#8217;t expect everyone to go out and buy the VOCALOIDs, some people simply don&#8217;t have the money, and other are more interested in listening to what other people make with these voices (and there&#8217;s no fault in that).</p>
<p>But there are other ways you can support these companies. Simply being kind, sharing the software with friends or others who might be interested, supporting producers who choose to primarily use English VOCALOIDs, those are some excellent ways to help out these companies.</p>
<p>I also thanked everyone who continues to be so generous and so wonderful in regards to their feedback on their releases, as that&#8217;s half the battle right there. English VOCALOID as a medium cannot continue to exist without you wonderful people.</p></blockquote>
<figure id="attachment_2083" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2083" style="width: 995px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/TiesThatBind.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2083 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/TiesThatBind-995x1024.jpg" alt="" width="995" height="1024" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2083" class="wp-caption-text">Art by AkiGlancy/EmpathP</figcaption></figure>
<p>No matter what happens, the VOCALOID is never at fault and should not be punished for any anger held towards a company. Despite the drama in the past few months, EmpathP asks that everyone remembers we&#8217;re hurting English VOCALOIDs as a whole. Not supporting an English VOCALOID makes it less likely that more will be released in the future.</p>
<h5>Merchandise</h5>
<p>Though there are no plans for official Dex and Daina products, there will be albums and other small items featuring the two.</p>
<p>At the moment, EmpathP has used the &#8220;Flufferpuffer&#8221; art (the art of Dex and Daina as full animals) for small coin purses.</p>
<p>The album &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/Al/15106" target="_blank">A Wicked Girl and a Tin Boy</a>&#8221; will also feature the two.</p>
<p>Though these items aren&#8217;t official, they still show support and can bring more attention to English VOCALOIDs.</p>
<h3>Trivia</h3>
<p>&#8220;Daina&#8221; is pronounced as a Latvian name. In that language, her name means &#8220;song&#8221;. This was completely unintentional!</p>
<p>The name &#8220;Dex&#8221; is less fancy. EmpathP and Kenji-B just liked the name.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s currently unknown if Zero-G will reveal Dex&#8217;s and Daina&#8217;s voice providers before February. If they don&#8217;t, EmpathP will reveal the voice providers at <a href="http://www.katsucon.org/" target="_blank">Katsucon</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/2434" target="_blank">EmpathP</a> hosted the third <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/36169" target="_blank">Dex</a> and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/36170" target="_blank">Daina</a> live stream <a href="https://youtu.be/8qSgYIncWxE" target="_blank">on YouTube</a>. She went into detail about the design changes and lack of boxed versions for the two, both of which were covered last week on Vocaloid Otaku and talked about <a href="http://rayduxz.cl/vocaloid/en/2015/10/23/dex-and-daina-update-design-change-and-boxed-version/" target="_blank">in a previous VNN article</a>. She also gave more information on other topics such as rumors surrounding <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/201" target="_blank">Zero-G</a>&#8216;s next project and how to support English VOCALOIDs.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2083" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2083" style="width: 483px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://rayduxz.cl/vnn/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2015/10/TiesThatBind.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2083" src="https://rayduxz.cl/vnn/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2015/10/TiesThatBind.jpg" alt="Art by AkiGlancy/EmpathP" width="483" height="497" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TiesThatBind.jpg 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TiesThatBind-292x300.jpg 292w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TiesThatBind-995x1024.jpg 995w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2083" class="wp-caption-text">Art by <a href="http://akiglancy.deviantart.com/art/Ties-that-Bind-566069928" target="_blank">AkiGlancy/EmpathP</a></figcaption></figure>
<h3>Boxed Versions</h3>
<p>As stated in the previous article, there are currently no plans for Dex and Daina to receive official boxed versions. EmpathP suggested that Zero-G make a PDF file that fans can use to make their own physical copies but she is unsure whether or not the company will take this idea. The biggest problem is that providing such a file could allow people to sell physical bootlegs of Dex and Daina.</p>
<p>Not only will that impact Zero-G&#8217;s sales but also it would just be bad for everyone involved. Imagine purchasing a boxed version of a VOCALOID at a con only to find out it was pirated.</p>
<p>The good news is that the lack of a boxed version allows people to use the designs they prefer. Oftentimes, people feel pressured to draw the VOCALOID as it&#8217;s featured on their box art. As for Dex and Daina, the box art will be the two without their ears and tails. Without a physical copy, the two designs can be used by fans without one being deemed the &#8220;right&#8221; one.</p>
<p>EmpathP says that for the moment, there&#8217;s not much of a chance for boxed versions of Zero-G VOCALOIDs to be available. She believes that Zero-G needs to see that physical copies will sell as well as or better than digital downloads. This is because Zero-G only receives 60% of each physical copy sale. (For every $1,000 USD earned, they get $600 USD.)</p>
<figure id="attachment_2056" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2056" style="width: 212px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://rayduxz.cl/vnn/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2015/10/Dex.png"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2056" src="https://rayduxz.cl/vnn/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2015/10/Dex.png" alt="Art by SteelEmissary " width="212" height="737" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Dex.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Dex-86x300.png 86w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Dex-294x1024.png 294w" sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2056" class="wp-caption-text">Art by <a href="http://steelemissary.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">SteelEmissary</a></figcaption></figure>
<h3>Design Changes</h3>
<p>Yet another topic covered before was the design changes. EmpathP mentioned <a href="http://www.vocaloidotaku.net/index.php?/topic/60706-dex-and-daina-two-new-vocaloids-from-zero-g/page__view__findpost__p__1305299" target="_blank">on Vocaloid Otaku</a> that Dex and Daina would not have the designs everyone&#8217;s seen. However, she did say that the change was &#8220;very unobtrusive&#8221;. In the live stream, she gave us more details on the matter.</p>
<p>For the art that Zero-G plans to primarily use, Dex and Daina will <strong>not</strong> have their ears and tails. They will however still fit the &#8220;The Fox and the Hound&#8221; theme.</p>
<p>Instead of the ears and tails, the duo will have headphones that cover their human ears. Daina&#8217;s will be black with blue luminescent pieces, including a blue fox head on the speaker part of the headphones. Dex will have black headphones with yellow luminescent pieces, including a yellow wolf head on the speaker part of the headphones.</p>
<p>Besides that, the designs will remain the same. Dex and Daina will wear the same clothes and be in the same pose.</p>
<p>In addition, it was confirmed that both designs will be considered canon. It&#8217;s unknown if Zero-G will be using the designs with the ears and tails, however.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to take note that these design changes were made by EmpathP, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/9940" target="_blank">Kenji-B</a>, and <a href="http://steelemissary.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">SteelEmissary</a>. The group completely understands why Zero-G went with the different approach and are perfectly okay with it.</p>
<p>Plus, with both designs being considered canon, every fan gets what they want. Those who like the kemonomimi designs can keep using them while those who don&#8217;t will have the alternative version that they can draw.</p>
<h5>Zero-G&#8217;s Decision</h5>
<p>Zero-G decided to go with the alternative design due to their market. They market their products to professional musicians who may not be very keen on characters as anime-styled as the original Dex and Daina designs. Though the two will still maintain everything else about their original design, even the fandom itself has proved to have very mixed reactions when it comes to the ears and tails. Professionals will likely be even more turned off by such extras.</p>
<h5>Fun Fact</h5>
<p>Though the idea isn&#8217;t canon, EmpathP and Kenji-B like to think that the headphones allow Dex and Daina to transform through their songs. When the two sing, they gain their ears and tails.</p>
<p>EmpathP also imagines something similar for <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/2803" target="_blank">Avanna</a>, the VOCALOID she drew the official art for. When Avanna sings, the rings on her outfit turn and she transforms into an elf.</p>
<p>These transformations were all compared to magical girl transformations.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2358" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2358" style="width: 412px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://rayduxz.cl/vnn/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2015/10/secret_agent_by_akiglancy-d9eku2e.png"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2358" src="https://rayduxz.cl/vnn/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2015/10/secret_agent_by_akiglancy-d9eku2e.png" alt="Art by AkiGlancy/EmpathP" width="412" height="549" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/secret_agent_by_akiglancy-d9eku2e.png 900w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/secret_agent_by_akiglancy-d9eku2e-225x300.png 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/secret_agent_by_akiglancy-d9eku2e-768x1024.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/secret_agent_by_akiglancy-d9eku2e-600x800.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2358" class="wp-caption-text">Art by <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/art/Secret-Agent-568682294" target="_blank">AkiGlancy/EmpathP</a></figcaption></figure>
<h3>Supporting English Vocals</h3>
<p>As it&#8217;s been stated before, EmpathP encourages everyone to support English VOCALOIDs in any way possible. Even if you&#8217;re unable to buy or uninterested in buying the VOCALOIDs, just writing to the company that made the voice bank and thanking them makes a huge difference.</p>
<p>This goes for <strong>all</strong> English VOCALOIDs. EmpathP even spoke on <a href="http://rayduxz.cl/vocaloid/en/2015/07/17/ruby-summary/">the Ruby incident</a>. Though many things are still unclear about it, EmpathP said that she knows Mr. Anders very well and that he&#8217;s acknowledged that he&#8217;s done wrong. He doesn&#8217;t mean to offend everyone but cannot make a public apology due to how the fandom reacts.  As we&#8217;ve seen with the bombardment of hate mail sent to PFX and so many comments hating Dex and Daina for their ears and tails, as well as outright calling them disgusting, the fandom is very quick to brutally strike anyone that comes in shooting range.</p>
<h3>Zero-G Is Waiting on YAMAHA</h3>
<p>Dex and Daina are ready to go. Once YAMAHA gives everyone the okay, the two will be released for digital download. No one can give an exact date yet but hopefully it will be soon!</p>
<h3>Zero-G&#8217;s Next Project</h3>
<p>Someone in the stream asked if Zero-G was currently working on a Rock vocal. She can&#8217;t confirm anything at this time but said that it&#8217;s possible a Rock vocal could be in the planning stages. However, it&#8217;s also possible that the Rock vocal could just be a concept at the moment.</p>
<p>After Avanna was nearing release, Zero-G had three paths they thought of taking: A male Celtic vocal to compliment Avanna, a male and female American vocal (now known as Dex and Daina) or a Rock vocal. They decided that, at the time, American vocals were the best bet as the market didn&#8217;t have any at the time. Of course, now there is <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/25258" target="_blank">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/31020" target="_blank">CYBER DIVA</a>. But at the time when Avanna was being finished and set for release, this was a new idea.</p>
<p>Avanna was released in December of 2012 and Dex and Daina are likely to be released in either the fall or winter of 2015. This is nearly three years of development from a concept to full voice banks. We likely won&#8217;t hear anything confirmed for quite some time.</p>
<p>As a side note, the male Celtic vocal is not confirmed to be canceled. He&#8217;s currently in limbo due to Zero-G being unable to find a good vocalist for him.</p>
<h3>Demos</h3>
<p>Zero-G has asked EmpathP and Kenji-B not to release any full songs until Dex and Daina are released for sale. EmpathP was able to provide a new snippet for fans to listen to, however.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F230248193&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=618&#038;maxheight=927"></iframe></p>
<p>You can find more demos on EmpathP&#8217;s <a href="https://soundcloud.com/akiglancy" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmvmOALS_lj0ZD7Mg7AD7aQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a> as well as Kenji-B&#8217;s <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nostraightanswer" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>.</p>

<h3>Boxed Version</h3>
<p>Due to the cost of manufacturing the boxed versions of VOCALOIDs, Zero-G has decided that Dex and Daina will <strong>not </strong>be receiving physical copies. Fans will only be able to buy digital downloads of the newest English VOCALOIDs.</p>
<p>According to EmpathP:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s a matter of numbers. As I work in DVD and CD printing I know how much it costs to get these things made&#8230;. Now you may also say &#8220;but Aki, if they sell 50 units at around $120 each, they&#8217;ll be making several thousand dollars. How is that not profit?&#8221; Well it&#8217;s not profit for a very simple reason: Zero-G will probably only see about 60% of that sale (if they&#8217;re lucky). As I had stated in my last post, the company sells their physical releases through Time + Space. As with all distributors, they take a piece of the pie with each sale. Then there&#8217;s Yamaha. I believe Yamaha also takes a fraction of physical sales (this is not confirmed, this is just an informed theory). And then of course there&#8217;s taxes and the like (and have it on good authority that the European tax system is not great).</p>
<p>So this leads to the most logical decision: to distribute only digitally until such a time as can be shown that it is more profitable to distribute physical copies as well.</p></blockquote>

<h5>Making Your Own Boxed Version</h5>
<p>EmpathP encourages fans who did want a physical release to stay hopeful. Though you definitely won&#8217;t be able to purchase an official boxed version, there&#8217;s a chance that you&#8217;ll be able to make your own.</p>
<p>From EmpathP&#8217;s post:</p>
<blockquote><p>After all, we&#8217;ve dealt with digital only releases in the past (such as Bruno and Clara&#8217;s first edition, Big-Al and Sweet Ann, ect). It certainly dos not have I be the end of the world. For my part, I&#8217;m going to ask if Zero-G will be willing to provide a DVD printable mock up with the release do that you all my make your own DVDs at home (similar to Galaco&#8217;s first iteration)</p></blockquote>
<p>As many have pointed out, boxed versions are especially important to fans when it comes to English VOCALOIDs. Very rarely will any merchandise be released for these VOCALOIDs and, as a result, the boxed versions give fans something physical that shows their adoration of the characters and voices. Should Zero-G agree to releasing a printable mock up, fans will be able to make their own physical copies to display on their shelves.</p>
<h3>Design &#8220;Change&#8221;</h3>
<p>The designs we&#8217;ve been using to represent Dex and Daina are <strong>not </strong>going to be the official designs used by Zero-G. As those following the two VOCALOIDs know, it was never confirmed that the art being used would be the final artwork used.</p>
<p>At this time, we don&#8217;t have the art or any specifics but we do know that Dex and Daina will not have their tails or ears anymore. They will still fit the &#8220;Fox and the Hound&#8221; theme and have a design similar to the one that&#8217;s been used by EmpathP and Kenji-B, however.</p>
<blockquote><p>I can confirm that Zero-G did choose one of the alt designs for Dex and Daina, but it was the very unobtrusive one with only slight changes made to appeal to non Japanese-style fans and they still fit in the theme of &#8220;the fox and <del>he</del> hound&#8221;. Thus, with no physical release, those who prefer the ears and tails will be far less pressured by a DVD box art not containing said ears and tails. Everyone wins in that situation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once we have more on the design changes, we will be sure to update you.</p>
<h3>A Friendly Reminder</h3>
<figure id="attachment_2081" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081" style="width: 687px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://rayduxz.cl/vnn/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2015/10/flufferpuffer_by_akiglancy-d8yaus3.png"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2081" src="https://rayduxz.cl/vnn/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2015/10/flufferpuffer_by_akiglancy-d8yaus3.png" alt="Art by AkiGlancy/EmpathP" width="687" height="438" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/flufferpuffer_by_akiglancy-d8yaus3.png 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/flufferpuffer_by_akiglancy-d8yaus3-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2081" class="wp-caption-text">Art by <a href="http://akiglancy.deviantart.com/art/flufferpuffer-541342803" target="_blank">AkiGlancy/EmpathP</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>As EmpathP stated <a href="http://rayduxz.cl/vocaloid/en/2015/10/16/more-information-on-dex-and-daina-revealed/" target="_blank">in one of her live streams</a> and <a href="http://rayduxz.cl/vocaloid/en/2015/10/16/more-information-on-dex-and-daina-revealed/" target="_blank">stressed on her Facebook</a>, it&#8217;s important for fans to support Dex and Daina and all Engloids. Many people are claiming that they will no longer buy Dex and Daina if the two aren&#8217;t given boxed versions. <strong>This hurts the VOCALOIDs more than the company. </strong></p>
<p>Zero-G is simply trying to make good financial decisions. Everyone knows that English VOCALOIDs don&#8217;t sell well and with recent drama, sales and interest have gone down. The idea of punishing a company for doing something you don&#8217;t like doesn&#8217;t work as well as you may think. Especially in this case.</p>
<p>If enough fans show interest in Dex and Daina, they may receive more voice banks for XSY in the future. And should the interest be huge, Zero-G could very well release physical copies for these &#8220;appends&#8221;. Not buying Dex and Daina just because there isn&#8217;t a boxed version only manages to shrink sales even more. And with small sales, we can guarantee Dex and Daina will never receive any update.</p>
<p>EmpathP and Kenji-B are perfectly okay with Dex and Daina not receiving physical versions and they understand why the two VOCALOIDs needed a small design change. They are perfectly happy with how everything is going. If they&#8217;re happy, there&#8217;s no reason not to be. Celebrate the release of two amazing American English vocals. Support English VOCALOIDs and show companies that there <strong>is </strong>a market for English VOCALOIDs.</p>
<p>Who knows. Maybe one day we&#8217;ll get Dex and Daina appends.</p>

<p>Aki Glancy happens to own many VOCALOID voice banks. Therefore, I approached Aki to see if she would be interested in giving us some tips on getting started as a VOCALOID producer, as well as how she became one herself.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is Aki Glancy (<a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/2434" target="_blank">EmpathP</a>)?</strong></p>

<p>She is an illustrator, producer of VOCALOID and UTAU music, and she does some utaite work of her own. EmpathP has been asked to do demos for many VOCALOIDs including <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/13431" target="_blank">MAIKA</a> (&#8220;<em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/45073" target="_blank">Waves of Change</a></em>&#8220;) and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/5591" target="_blank">KAITO V3 English</a> (&#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/37911" target="_blank">Anonymous</a>&#8220;). She gained her producer name for creating very emotional songs that tug at the heartstrings of many listeners.</p>
<p>She is also the illustrator for the VOCALOID <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/2803" target="_blank">AVANNA</a>.</p>

<p><b><br />
</b><strong>Monds: </strong><em>How did you discover VOCALOID?</em></p>
<p><b> </b><strong>Aki Glancy: </strong>Well, I actually learned about Vocaloid back in the fall of 2008 through someone&#8217;s fan made CaramellDansen video. It featured 3-D animated Nendoroid versions of the Vocaloids that existed up to that point, dancing to the song. As I was an animation major in college at the time, my first assumption was that the models used in the video, were models ripped from a video game (as that was something popular that was occurring at the time). But, when I looked up the term &#8220;Vocaloid&#8221;. I instead found out about the software and the slowly but steadily growing musical phenomenon it was bringing to the world.</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ext.nicovideo.jp/thumb_watch/sm2321776?w=490&h=307"></script><noscript><a href="https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm2321776">NicoNico</a></noscript>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monds: </strong><em>That is an interesting way of discovering it, at least you learned about it the proper way, a lot of new people to VOCALOID started off thinking it was anime haha.</em></p>
<p><em>What made you want to become a producer?<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b> </b><strong>Aki Glancy: </strong>The funny thing is, I never actually wanted to be a producer. I had thought about it before, although on my birthday in 2009 (a few months after discovering Vocaloid), I DID buy my first Vocaloid (<a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/388" target="_blank">MIRIAM</a>) and played around with the programming. But, there was something about it that I was having a hard time grasping. So, I decided to be a casual fan and simply admire the music others were creating.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It wasn&#8217;t until I befriended a UTAU producer by the name of <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/13192" target="_blank">MystSaphyr</a> that I got into the &#8220;production&#8221; side of things. Myst convinced me to make my first UTAU. After I had, I found that I REALLY enjoyed using the UTAU program and making covers. Around that time, another friend of mine named <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/919" target="_blank">Circus-P</a> made his first original song [&#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/93621" target="_blank">Creepy Toast</a>&#8220;]. It was really well received and I thought to myself &#8220;Perhaps I should give making a song a go.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I already had training in music theory and piano, all I needed was the tools. I made an inquiry on twitter and one of my little girlfriends suggested a program called Mixcraft 5. I downloaded the free trial and within 2 days I had composed my first original song. The rest was history. I ended up turning to music production to ease the stress of my work with animation (which I just didn&#8217;t feel the same passion for).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monds: </strong><em>I can imagine MIRIAM being a V1 VOCALOID and the technology being young at the time, it would be more difficult to start in VOCALOID then it is nowadays. It does seem you know many people in the industry and many people seem to know you as well.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>I have seen your video of VOCALOID recommendations on YouTube speaking of beginner, intermediate and expert VOCALOIDs. I can see you own many of them and have some experience with a wide variety of VOCALOIDs, is there one specifically you would recommend that you prefer to use over the others?</em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Mnf0JI8i1E" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><strong>Aki Glancy: </strong>Yes, in my video I list quite a few Vocaloids I would recommend for beginners. Let me give you a smaller list for now.</p>
<ul>
<li>For producers planning to make <strong>Japanese</strong> music or covers, I recommend ANY of the <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/25" target="_blank">Crypton Future Media</a> Vocaloids (<a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/1" target="_blank">Miku</a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/71" target="_blank">Kaito</a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/176" target="_blank">Meiko</a>, ect.). They hold pitch extremely well and are the easiest Vocaloids I&#8217;ve ever worked with.</li>
<li>For <strong>English</strong> users, I would recommend Avanna and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/11778" target="_blank">Yohioloid</a>. Both of them have some of the most understandable English pronunciation.</li>
<li>Now, currently I don&#8217;t have <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/31020" target="_blank">Cyber Diva</a>, but I AM working with 2 brand new <strong>American English</strong> Vocaloids who are currently slated for release in Summer of this year. Their names are <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/36169" target="_blank">Dex</a> and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/36170" target="_blank">Daina</a>. I believe they will be very attractive to beginners because of their voice types and how easy they are to use.</li>
<li>Another <strong>American English</strong> Vocaloid named Ruby is also going to be released soon. I&#8217;ve worked with her early beta, back when she was still a V3 and she was fantastic.</li>
<li>And finally, if you want to use <strong>Spanish</strong>, any <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/989" target="_blank">Voctro Labs</a> Vocaloids (<a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/385" target="_blank">Clara</a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/384" target="_blank">Bruno</a> or <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/13431" target="_blank">Maika</a>) are EXCELLENT.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monds: </strong><em>I see many people ask what VOCALOID they should start with, I myself have been asked this question. I am sure this will help them on deciding the one to start with. I have heard Dex and Daina. I was at both of the streams, the announcement and your follow-up. They sound really great and clear for English VOCALOIDs, I am excited to hear more of them in the future.</em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DUGLW8koaJs" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Monds: </strong><em>How did it feel to be contacted by <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/201" target="_blank">ZERO-G </a>about Avanna?</em></p>
<p><b> </b><strong>Aki Glancy: </strong>When Zero-G contacted me to work on Avanna, I was shocked. I had previously sent them a portfolio of works, but the intention of that inquiry was to make music demos for their new Vocaloids. The fact that I was chosen to do artwork instead was remarkable to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monds: </strong><em>I can imagine you were shocked, I think most artists would be honored to be asked to do the art for any VOCALOID. It seems to have given you a much closer relationship with Zero-G as well.</em></p>
<p><em>Any other tips for new producers just getting started? I know making the decision to start producing music isn&#8217;t always an easy task when you&#8217;re not sure how to go about it.</em></p>
<p><b> </b><strong>Aki Glancy: </strong>I have 2 primary things I would like to say to new producers:</p>
<p>1.) Take the time to learn music theory if you don&#8217;t already know it. This will help you SO MUCH in the future when you make your own music. It&#8217;s very easy to learn and you can find numerous free instruction videos via YouTube, as well as several different websites that also give the basics.</p>
<p>2.) DO NOT become a Vocaloid producer to become famous.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s still a lot of young UTAU or Vocaloid fans out there who think &#8220;If I make an UTAU of my own or start making music, I could become really famous and get to do a lot of things!&#8221; This truly is not the case.</p>
<p>Vocaloid producers like myself, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/919" target="_blank">Circus-P</a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/9940" target="_blank">Kenji-B</a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/5045" target="_blank">AdyS</a> and others have only gotten our status through a LOT of hard work and determination. And we KEEP doing what we do because we LOVE it.</p>
<p>In the end, Vocaloid is still not an established phenomenon here in the US. The chances of you being signed to a record label or getting any kind of TRUE recognition from the music world for what you do, is slim at best. If you want to become an UTAU or Vocaloid producer, do so because you LOVE the medium and you LOVE music; and also that you wish to share that with the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monds: </strong><em>Great words of advice for anything you enjoy. You should always do it because you love it and not for the fame. If you truly are passionate about what you do people will take notice of your great work even though it may take some time.</em></p>
<p><em>Is there a song that you have made that is important to you, one you wish everyone would hear?</em></p>
<p><b> </b><strong>Aki Glancy: </strong>I think the song I would recommend to anyone new to my music would be a song I wrote called &#8220;Witness&#8221;. It was a song I wrote for Crypton Future Media as a demo for <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16053" target="_blank">Meiko</a>&#8216;s new English voice bank and it&#8217;s one of my favorite songs that I have composed.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8M4_BGV9hUg" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Monds: </strong><em>My last question will be, is there anything you would like to say to the readers or even to the people who enjoy what you do?</em></p>
<p><b> </b><strong>Aki Glancy: </strong>To your readers, I would like to convey my deepest and sincerest love and thanks. I would be no where in the world without the support they&#8217;ve given me. I would like to encourage everyone to PLEASE continue to support English Vocaloid releases, from English producers to the software themselves. The only way Vocaloid can grow as a phenomenon in the US, is if we continue to show our support to the companies that publish these amazing English Vocaloids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monds: </strong><em>Thank you very much for taking the time to answer my questions and share your passion with others. Looking forward to seeing more from you in the future and hopefully others will as well.</em></p>
<p><b> </b><strong>Aki Glancy: </strong>Thank YOU for all you do to spread the love of Vocaloid. It means a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Monds: </strong><em>Thank you, I&#8217;m glad to hear that. I am just a passionate fan of VOCALOID, who&#8217;s only wish is to share my passion with others and to steer people in the right direction.</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Those familiar with the VOCALOID SONiKA are aware that she is not the easiest VOCALOID to use. From noise that affects her raw vocals to pronunciation issues, she has issues that make her much more difficult to use than many other English VOCALOIDs.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those familiar with the VOCALOID <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/200" target="_blank">SONiKA</a> are aware that she is not the easiest VOCALOID to use. From noise that affects her raw vocals to pronunciation issues, she has issues that make her much more difficult to use than many other English VOCALOIDs. Yet some producers can get her to sound absolutely incredible.</p>

<p>So I thought I would ask one of the more experienced SONiKA users, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/5045" target="_blank">AdyS</a>, for his thoughts on the matter.</p>

<p>AdyS is a producer well known for his work with the VOCALOID SONiKA. He&#8217;s also used many other English voice banks including <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/383" target="_blank">Oliver</a> and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/2803" target="_blank">AVANNA</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monds:</strong> <em>How did you discover VOCALOID?</em></p>
<p><strong>AdyS</strong>:<b> </b>Hmm, it was a long time ago around 2008-2009 when I first discovered Vocaloid thanks to, well, &#8220;the one and only&#8221; <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/1" target="_blank">Hatsune Miku</a>. I didn&#8217;t know much about her or Vocaloid in general. I just saw her videos and images pop up on the internet. I was just curious to know who she was. I thought she was just a character in an anime or something. But I did know she had some cool songs like the classic <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/2443" target="_blank"><em>&#8220;last night good night&#8221;</em></a> (which is also one of my favorites). In general, though, I did not really care much about Vocaloid so it took me a while to figure out that she was actually a voice synthesizer and not a character in an anime. lol</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T6mMMYSqlM4" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Monds:</strong> <em>I think a lot of us started off thinking that VOCALOID was an anime. haha<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>AdyS:</strong><b> </b>It was not until late 2010, where I started to have an interest in Vocaloid, which was also around the time I bought FL Studio. I really wanted to make my own songs and all that [but] I still had zero interest [in making] a Vocaloid song back then. I just wanted to make music, mostly trance and hands-up (and sometimes hip hop, I was really inconsistent back then). I went [by] different artist names, too (which I don&#8217;t really remember lol).</p>
<p>Oh. And the reason why I was interested in Vocaloid even though I didn&#8217;t intend to make a Vocaloid song was because I wanted to have some kind of vocals on my track. I just thought it would be cool. I didn&#8217;t really know how to write lyrics back then, though, but it didn&#8217;t matter since I just wanted to use Vocaloid as an instrument anyway, not really a &#8220;singer&#8221;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monds:</strong><b> </b><em>It is true that having a VOCALOID is much easier than finding a real singer and you can tune it to how you would like it to sound. Not really possible with humans.</em></p>
<p><strong>AdyS:</strong><b> </b>Little did I know, English Vocaloid was not at all the thing back then. I mean, sure you had <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/388" target="_blank">Miriam</a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/386" target="_blank">LEON</a> and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/387" target="_blank">LOLA</a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/389" target="_blank">Prima</a>, or even <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/390" target="_blank">Tonio</a>, I guess. (Japanese Vocaloid was out of the equation because I can&#8217;t read Japanese and thus I didn&#8217;t know how to buy them). I thought they had a young &#8220;pop-ish&#8221; female ENGLISH Vocaloid like Miku, well there was Sonika. It was close to what I wanted, I guess. I didn’t have a lot of choices anyway back then. So without any hesitation, I just bought her and decided that this will be my Vocaloid from now on. I spent some time playing with her, editing, experimenting, and tuning (which is a term I didn&#8217;t know before). After a while, I started to make some songs with her. Just a simple trance or hip hop song with her vocals on top of it. Not much, really.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monds:</strong> <em>You do an amazing job with SONiKA and I never hesitate to share your work with others whenever I speak of SONiKA. I can tell you spent a lot of time working with her, where others have given up.</em></p>
<p><strong>AdyS:</strong><b> </b>After a while of using her, I started to add more and more lyrics and put more efforts on the vocals. Eventually I came up with an actual Vocaloid original song, which was my song &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/50993" target="_blank">Everyone&#8217;s Going Down</a>&#8220;. I didn&#8217;t expect much from this song really, just wanted to try something different. Back then I didn&#8217;t expect this song to get a lot of views at all. Well, not much, but for a &#8220;noobish&#8221; musician like me, back then getting close to 1k views in one week was HUGE. Obviously, this was primarily my motivation to make more and more songs using Vocaloid as a &#8220;singer&#8221; and not just an instrument. &#8220;Fade Away&#8221; was another &#8220;big hit&#8221; that I would call it, since again, I didn&#8217;t expect to get a lot of views with this. It actually started from there too, where I started to make less trance/dance/hiphop etc, and focused more on making Vocaloid original songs. Basically this channel is now a Vocaloid channel and not an EDM channel as people would call it, which was what I intended to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OtMgQLGjyFc" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monds:</strong><b> &#8220;</b><em>Fade Away&#8221; Happens to be one of my favorite songs. I cannot help but listen to it at least 2-3 time in a row as well as &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/51157" target="_blank">A Parallel</a>&#8220;.</em></p>
<p><em>Is there a song that you made that has a special meaning to it, that you would like everyone to hear?</em></p>
<p><strong>AdyS:</strong><b> </b>Hmm it&#8217;s really hard to choose. Pretty much every song in my latest 2 albums I guess ? (&#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/Al/8014" target="_blank">Bridges to Cross and Witches to Burn</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/Al/12246" target="_blank">So What</a>&#8220;).</p>
<p>The first one is basically me trying to make a soundtrack for an &#8220;anime&#8221;, which I made up myself in my head. It’s about &#8220;making the world a better place, without making it a better place&#8221;. The second one is kinda about my own &#8220;journey&#8221; as a musician but using love songs to convey the message somehow. lol.</p>
<p>If I have to choose :</p>
<p>1.<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/47885" target="_blank">Brainwashed Love</a></p>
<p>2.<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/49805" target="_blank">Witches&#8217;s Love</a></p>
<p>3.<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/73915" target="_blank">Black Hole</a></p>
<p>4.<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/79364" target="_blank">Desire</a></p>
<p>5.<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/79366" target="_blank">One By One</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monds:</strong><b> </b><em>Do you have any tips for newer producers just getting started?</em></p>
<p><strong>AdyS:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I would suggest [for new producers] to learn one basic chord progression first and then stick to that same chord progression but try to vary your instrumentation and/or groove for each song. When you feel comfortable making songs with said progression (by that I mean you can make a quick song with it no problem), try different progression.</li>
<li>For Vocaloid, make sure you tune efficiently! Don&#8217;t just add pitch bends/vibrato etc. all over the place blindly. Ask yourself, do you need to bend the pitch here? Is it necessary? Does it sound better? etc. Make your tuning simple, of course. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with complex tuning but make sure it actually contributes something good to the vocals. Same goes for mixing vocals; make it simple! Usually you will only need an EQ, a compressor, and a delay/re-verb (sometimes de-esser). In general you should have at most 3-4 plugins for your vocals and not more (unless you want to add creative effects like radio effects).</li>
<li>Lastly, listen to a lot, and I mean a lot of songs. Just listen. Listen to them religiously, analyze, ask questions.<br />
&#8220;Why does this drum sound cool?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Why does this vocal sound rich?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;How did they make it sound so complex?&#8221;<br />
Sometimes what you need is not really tutorials, how to instructions, tips, or tricks. Sometimes you just have to listen so that your brain will have the right perception/intuition on how good songs should sound.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>Monds:</strong><b> </b><em>That is some good advice, I am no producer myself, however I have watched some of your videos where you explain FL studio such as mixing and all that kind of stuff. Its an interesting watch. I am sure for someone starting out they could learn a thing or two by watching them.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zZpuSeOPccE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AdyS:</strong><b> </b>Yeah I really hope it could help people, because I still have a hard time explaining things to others. But that is not the reason why I wanted to make these kinds of videos in the first place. I wish to improve my communication skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monds:</strong><b> </b><em>That is a good way to look at it. Being from France I assume your primary language is French? I am also French but from Canada.</em></p>
<p><strong>AdyS:</strong><b> </b>I&#8217;m living in France right now, but I&#8217;m actually from Malaysia, and I come here to study. I can speak French bien sûr.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monds:</strong><b> </b><em>Many people say SONiKA is very difficult to work with. What are your thoughts on this?</em></p>
<p><strong>AdyS:</strong><b> </b>I remember the first time I used her, I found it really difficult. But back then I thought it was just me who was still inexperienced in using the editor and it wasn&#8217;t the voice bank&#8217;s fault. So I spent quite a lot of time to make her sound good and try to find the different ways to fix her vocals. It was only after a while that I realized the voice bank <strong>is</strong> in fact hard to use and it wasn&#8217;t because of my lack of tuning skills (well actually partly because of that too lol). I heard people say that she&#8217;s a low quality voice bank and thus impossible to use, which I partly agree with. I mean, she&#8217;s hard to use, but it&#8217;s not impossible to make her sound good. She at least has a nice voice tone, which is what matters to me the most. I think people are just a bit too extreme with their opinion on Sonika or even Engloids in general, which unfortunately affects other people&#8217;s opinion on her and thus creating this one large &#8220;circlejerk&#8221; that thinks Engloids are bad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monds:</strong><b> </b><em>The quality I believe depends more on the producer than the VOCALOID. You have proved to us that with SONiKA. I have heard several people mention you as being very good with SONiKA and I would have to agree. Even though some people don&#8217;t like her, the ones who have heard your work know it&#8217;s not impossible.</em></p>
<p><em>Would you recommend her?</em></p>
<p><strong>AdyS:</strong><b> </b>Would I recommend her, though? Well, back then in 2010, I believe I would have. I had <strong>no</strong> choice at all; she was literally the only English Vocaloid close to the &#8220;pop-ish&#8221; young female voice type I was looking for. Nowadays, though, I would say you have no reason to buy her anymore since you have much better choices like AVANNA, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/4634" target="_blank">GUMI English</a> and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/31020" target="_blank">CYBER DIVA</a>. Unless, of course, you love Sonika so much that you love her character and such, you want to be a Vocaloid collector, or you want to keep it old school like me. lol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monds:</strong><b> </b><em>Sometimes when we don&#8217;t have many options in what we use, that is what motivates us to work harder, which was the case for you. Nothing wrong with wanting to stay old school. lol.</em></p>
<p><em>Is there anything else you would like to tell the people listening to your music or the readers?</em></p>
<p><strong>AdyS:</strong><b> </b>To all the people listening to my music and the readers, I would like to thank you simply for taking the time to listen to my songs. Hate them or love them, it doesn&#8217;t really matter to me as it makes me happy simply to have the opportunity to show my creative side to people. I would like to thank you for these questions, too, as it somehow reminds me of some of my old funny moments and memories in this fandom. haha.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monds:</strong><b> </b><em>As long as you are happy, that is all that matters and I am glad to hear you don&#8217;t let people get in the way of what you want to do. That is how it should be.</em></p>
<p><em> And no problem! It was a pleasure to do an interview with you as well.</em></p>
