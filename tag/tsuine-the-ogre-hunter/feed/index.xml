										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may remember about <strong>Tsuina the Ogre Hunter</strong>, the character voiced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mai_Kadowaki">Mai Kadowaki</a> that was announced to get a chance to become a VOICEROID, just like the Tohoku sisters did in the past, thanks to a crowdfunding campaign. Well, this cute little character has launched her campaign via <em>Greenfunding</em> and she needs our help to reach her goal!</p>
<h3>Who is Tsuina-chan?</h3>
<p>In case you don&#8217;t know her already, Tsuina the Ogre Hunter is a 14-year-old ogre hunter who always tries exorcising ogres during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setsubun">Setsubon</a> season, unfortunately often resulting unsuccessful. Her character was created by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/15063">Saki Oohenri</a>, the same creator of <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/13449">Hinomoto Oniko</a>&#8216;s meme (You may know also Oniko as the character from the song &#8220;<a href="https://vocadb.net/S/15058">HAKUMEI</a>&#8221; composed by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/366">azuma</a>. She previously used <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/117">VY1</a> as vocal, then became an UTAU on her own). Tsuina is voiced by Mai Kadowaki and her fan and supporter can contribuite to her projects by donating money to her. Contributors to her project would receive her voice dramas files, her manga and a lot more. Tsuina became popular over time and even started promoting traditional Japanese culture and ceremonies!</p>
