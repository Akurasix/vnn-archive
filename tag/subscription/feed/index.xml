					<description><![CDATA[<p>VNN is happy to add a subscription system to our website. This way, you can be sure you don&#8217;t miss anything of importance. We know that there are many reasons one could miss something important or interesting, whether it&#8217;s being busy with school/work, Facebook&#8217;s news feed algorithm, or even not being big on social media. &#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>VNN is happy to add a subscription system to our website. This way, you can be sure you don&#8217;t miss anything of importance. We know that there are many reasons one could miss something important or interesting, whether it&#8217;s being busy with school/work, Facebook&#8217;s news feed algorithm, or even not being big on social media. Now you don&#8217;t have to run around looking for it — you can receive a simple email!</p>
<h3>How to Subscribe?</h3>
<p>Easy! Just scroll down to the bottom of any page in the language of your preference, enter your email, and hit the subscribe button. Afterwards, head on over to your email inbox and confirm your subscription! If you are wondering how frequent these will be, don&#8217;t worry. We understand that no one wants to receive constant emails when subscribing to something. We have kept this in mind when incorporating this feature and we have decided to keep it to once a week.</p>
<p>We will also be implementing a system where we will send out emails for big news only, such as the release of a new voice bank, a big event, or a contest/giveaway being held to ensure that you can catch all the good stuff in time. Not only that but also for limited products you will be able to get it first! Stay tuned for more!</p>
