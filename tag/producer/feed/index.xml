<p><a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/292">Siinamota</a>&#8211;also known as <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/292">PowapowaP</a>&#8211;was a well known and beloved Vocaloid music producer. He began making music in 2009, capturing the hearts of many with his electronic rock style.<a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/1"> Hatsune Miku </a>was featured in the majority of his music. Tracks and videos full of emotion and a vast range of genres were published by the young producer. <a href="https://vocadb.net/S/1834">Strobe Last</a>,  <a href="https://vocadb.net/S/525">Sora no Sakana</a>, and <a href="https://vocadb.net/S/38255">Palette ni wa Kimi ga Ippai</a> are just a few of his many notable works. <br><br>On July 26, 2015, Siinamota&#8217;s management announced he had passed away at a young age of 20. That day, whole community grieved. Many sent their condolences to Siinamota&#8217;s family and loved ones. Even now, many of us still mourn the loss of Siinamota.</p>



<h2> 故に 。- Therefore. album </h2>



<p>Only a select few of the label&#8217;s staff and the close friends of Siinamota worked on the songs he left behind. Thus, Michica Yo, <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/433">KTG</a>, sasanoumarii, and BokaroP arranged the whole album. </p>



<p>On July 9, 2019 Siinamota&#8217;s label released the &#8220;とりあえずアナタがいなくなるまえに&#8221; (For Now, Before You&#8217;re Gone) MV along with a link to pre-order the lost album. The album is titled <strong>Yueni </strong>or <strong>Therefore.</strong> Those who worked on the album made minimal changes to keep the album as close to how Siinamota would want it to sound. </p>

<p><em>Today is March 9, 2018, meaning it’s Miku Day. Already we have seen the release of <a href="http://panora.tokyo/50873/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hatsune Miku VR</a> on <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/707300/Hatsune_Miku_VR___VR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, further expanding the horizons for the popular virtual singer to numerous countries around the world.</em></p>
<p><em>And that&#8217;s only scratching the surface of all the different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xR (extended reality)</a> projects that Miku has been involved in recently, both in professional- (PGC) and user-generated content (UGC). For instance, on the PGC side, there were the &#8220;<a href="http://panora.tokyo/51890/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miku☆Sanpo</a>&#8221; AR app from <a href="http://www.kddi.com/english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KDDI</a>, the Playstation VR game &#8220;<a href="http://panora.tokyo/17782/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hatsune Miku VR Future Live</a>&#8221; from <a href="http://www.sega.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEGA Games</a>, the 360-degree music video app &#8220;<a href="http://panora.tokyo/51949/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VROOM</a>&#8221; from <a href="https://www.au.com/english/entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">au Uta Pass</a>, and the <a href="http://panora.tokyo/42656/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RICOH THETA SC Type HATSUNE MIKU</a> 360-degree camera from <a href="https://www.ricoh.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RICOH</a>. On the UGC side, we have seen <a href="http://panora.tokyo/44789/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a self-made PC which Miku can dance in</a><a href="http://panora.tokyo/51949/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">, </a>the Oculus Rift compatible &#8220;<a href="http://panora.tokyo/18052/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mikulus</a>&#8221; from <a href="https://twitter.com/goroman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOROman</a>, and much, much more.</em></p>
<p><em>The amount of xR content that involve Hatsune Miku is so innumerable that she&#8217;s no longer just a virtual singer, but arguably the poster child for all of modern technology. There are even many <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtual YouTubers</a> who called Miku their &#8220;senpai.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>And perhaps you have seen one name in particular that keeps showing up in all these different xR projects: the VOCALOID producer, BIGHEAD.</em></p>
<p><em>But what&#8217;s curious is that BIGHEAD rarely uploads his works onto Niconico. Always taking different approaches from other producers in Japan, it can perhaps be said that BIGHEAD represents the next generation of VOCALOID producers.</em></p>
<p><em>Our writer, Kazuhito Tsukui (a.k.a. SOSOSO) &#8211; who himself is an accomplished VOCAOID producer &#8211; has had the chance to interview this enigma known as BIGHEAD. In this interview on Miku Day, he delves deep into all activities carried out under the name BIGHEAD, the VOCALOID producer who&#8217;s leading the others into the future!</em></p>
<h2><span style="color: #cc2260">Discovering Miku During the Most Unrewarding of Times</span></h2>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bighead1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-172427" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bighead1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bighead1.jpg 680w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bighead1-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<p><em><b>――First, I&#8217;d like to ask something that came up while I was looking through your personal history. It says that before you started making VOCALOID music, you worked for a music company and wrote music for TV commercials. Would you say that these were your first forays into professional music creation?</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　Well, my main job was to handle recording and arrangements for Sapporo-based bands like <a href="http://a-f-r-o.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A.F.R.O.</a>, and creating commercial music was something that I did just a bit of. </em><em>When I was with the company, A.F.R.O. was still in their indies phase, and I was still a no-name. But when they finally made it into the big leagues, that&#8217;s when the name &#8220;BIGHEAD&#8221; started to garner attention, since I was in charge of arranging the songs in their album &#8220;7th,&#8221; released in 2015.</em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nfzGIWMYW4o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>▲Crossfade for A.F.R.O.&#8217;s album &#8220;7th&#8221;</p>
<p><em><b>――Even nowadays, I see that you&#8217;ve been assisting other people in making both VOCALOID and non-VOCALOID music alike.</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　I wasn&#8217;t able to find permanent work with A.F.R.O. or anyone else in Sapporo. However, I&#8217;ve been doing what you mentioned in hopes that the name &#8220;BIGHEAD&#8221; would grow, and that I can someday find work in the same field as them.</em></p>
<p><em><b>――I see. So you feel like you are trying to catch up to them.</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　Yes, exactly! I am really happy to have been given the chance to arrange music for them. I may have been a no-name was back when I was working for the company, but now I feel like the effort has finally been rewarded.</em></p>
<p><em><b>――Pardon me for putting it like this, but during those &#8220;unrewarding&#8221; times, what made you consider creating VOCALOID music?</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　Before working at the company, I played the drums and handled recording for my own band. At one point, we were contacted by a Sony-affiliated company that specializes in recruiting and rearing artists. We thought it could be our big chance at making it in the big leagues, but we ultimately failed at that</em><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>We didn&#8217;t exactly break up, but our mood was clouded over with the feeling that we would never get our big break. As a result, our vocalist eventually moved away, far enough so that we could not continue on with our band activities.</em></p>
<p><em>Since I could only play drums and arrange music, losing our vocalist left me feeling helpless. I called myself a musician, yet I didn&#8217;t have a single piece of work created under my name. I&#8217;m seriously bad at singing, you see. (laughs)</em></p>
<p><em><b>――Ah, I can totally relate. (laughs)</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　It was during that time that I discovered Hatsune Miku on the internet, and thought that she could serve as our vocalist.</em></p>
<p><em><b>――So it was like, when you desperately needed a vocalist, there Miku was.</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　Yes, precisely.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #cc2260">How BIGHEAD Almost Gave Up On Miku</span></h2>
<p><em><b>――So then you adopted the name &#8220;ElekiP&#8221; and began your activities as a VOCALOID producer, creating a cover of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daft_Punk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daft Punk</a> song. It didn&#8217;t occur to me that this was an extension of your band activities. Is there anything more to the story that I&#8217;m not aware of?</b></em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A2VpR8HahKc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>▲Official audio for Daft Punk&#8217;s &#8220;One more time&#8221;</p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　Well, our band was mainly an electronic music band. We&#8217;d use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitrack_recording" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MTR</a> and 2MIX to create synth music, I would play on drums, and we&#8217;d need a vocalist to sing&#8230; and probably other things that I don&#8217;t really understand myself. (laughs)</em></p>
<p><em><b>――That&#8217;s pretty interesting to hear!</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　Yea. (laughs) We were kind of an obscure band that was trying to be like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-Flo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">m-flo</a>, and made quite a lot of electronic music. Much of our music was created with synths.</em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RNBiaZbFGII?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>▲Official music video for m-flo&#8217;s &#8220;come again&#8221;</p>
<p><em><b>――So it must have been especially rough for a band like yours to lose its vocalist.</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　It sure was. Despite all my best efforts, there was nothing that I could do, and I lost a lot of motivation. Plus, searching for a new member would require a lot of energy that we didn&#8217;t have, so our band just broke up after that.</em></p>
<p><em><b>――So then you utilized your skills in making electronic music, brought in Hatsune Miku to provide vocals, and re-introduced your music to the world. Was that how ElekiP came to be?</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　I suppose so. However, even before making the Daft Punk cover, I was using Miku to make covers of Japanese songs that were originally sung by humans.</em></p>
<p><em><b>――Really?</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　Yup. I&#8217;ve never officially released them, but they were made during a time when I was trying to get Miku to sound as human as possible. I&#8217;d make one song per week, editing the vocals all the while. They came out pretty well, but there was something about them that rubbed me the wrong way.</em></p>
<p><em><b>――I think I can understand how you feel. (laughs)</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　I&#8217;m sure you can. (laughs) I couldn&#8217;t put my finger one it, but there was something that didn&#8217;t fit, something that I actually hated hearing. I even almost gave up on editing Miku completely.</em></p>
<p><em><b>――It sure is tough trying to edit a VOCALOID to sound human.</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　At one point, I even thought that there must have been an error or glitch in the program. (laughs) </em><em>The more I fiddled around with it, the worse her voice sounded, making me want to cringe. So I finally decided to give up on that direction, give up on trying to make Miku sound human while singing Japanese songs.</em></p>
<p><em><b>――Is that why you focus your efforts on techno music and other genres which you can utilize your music editing skills in?</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　That was my feeling at the time, yes. I&#8217;m quite partial to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocoder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vocoders</a> and synths.</em></p>
<p><em><b>――When you first used Hatsune Miku as the vocals for electronic music, did you ever imagine that it would grow and spread as far and wide as it has now?</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　Not at all! (laughs) When I first released &#8220;<a href="https://vocadb.net/S/32009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Story Rider</a>&#8221; in 2013, I had no idea that it would get this ridiculously big! (laughs)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #cc2260">The &#8220;Spam&#8221; Mail That Would Change BIGHEAD&#8217;s Life</span></h2>
<p><em><b>――Upon releasing &#8220;Story Rider&#8221; and the Daft Punk cover, you were then contacted by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crypton Future Media</a> who told you out of the blue <a href="http://blog.piapro.net/2013/10/2013-23.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that they would like to feature your song in New York</a>, right?</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　That&#8217;s right.</em></p>
<p><em><b>――How did you feel when you heard that Crypton Future Media would like to bring your creations with them to New York?</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　Hmm&#8230; the message that they relayed to me was &#8220;[Mr. Hiroyuki Itoh] will be hosting a panel [at the <a href="http://www.newyorkcomiccon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Comic Con</a>], and would like to use your song.&#8221; When I read those words, no particular thoughts or feelings came to mind, except maybe &#8220;What&#8217;s a panel?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em><b>――Is that so? (laughs)</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　I lacked even that much knowledge, so I just thought &#8220;So my songs will be playing in New York, huh.&#8221; I mean, the message wasn&#8217;t marked as spam, so </em><em>I was wondering if this really came from Crypton. (laughs).</em></p>
<p><em><b>――It does seem very sudden and suspicious-sounding! (laughs)</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　Sure was. (laughs) And since this was no small request, I imagined that Crypton was pretty desperate, too. At first, our only means of communication was through Facebook Messenger since they didn&#8217;t have my email address. So when the message came through Messenger, I just nonchalantly thought &#8220;Yeah, I suppose it&#8217;d be nice if they use my song&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em><b>――That&#8217;s quite the development that would eventually lead to your later endeavors under the name &#8220;BIGHEAD.&#8221;</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　If you had asked me, I would have thought that this would only be a one-time thing, and didn&#8217;t think much of it. But then &#8220;Story Rider&#8221; was later used in an opening act to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArtRave:_The_Artpop_Ball" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lady Gaga&#8217;s North American tour</a>, and &#8220;<a href="https://vocadb.net/S/66126" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharing The World</a>&#8221; was aired on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Show_with_David_Letterman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a CBS program</a> to all households in America. So looking back on it now, the New York Comic Con event was a very important beginning for me.</em></p>
<p><em><b>――You have done a lot of collaborative projects with Crypton, so much so that I personally see you as something of an official employee of Crypton.</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　It was quite an honor to see so many of my songs used at the <a href="http://magicalmirai.com/2017/index_en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magical Mirai</a> and <a href="/hatsune-miku-10th-anniversary-ppp-party-in-aeon-commences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPP-Party in Aeon</a> events last year, and at the <a href="https://snowmiku.com/2018/info_snowmiku_en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snow Miku</a> event this year!</em></p>

<p><em><b>――I guess I should have known that you would feel that way.</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　I think you misunderstand me. If I could, I&#8217;d take back what I said. (laughs)</em></p>
<p><em><b>――You mean you don&#8217;t like being thought of as an &#8220;official employee&#8221; of Crypton?</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　I wouldn&#8217;t like it if people thought &#8220;I can make better songs than him, so why did <strong>he</strong> get picked?&#8221; After all, when I started using Miku, I also thought that all those producers who were picked to do official work with Crypton must have needed connections or luck to get where they are. I myself have been jealous of famous VOCALOID producers before.</em></p>
<p><em><b>――Ah, yes, I&#8217;ve also been misunderstood that way before. (wry smile)</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　Getting official requests from Crypton makes me really happy, and I leap for joy every time it happens. However, in reality, I&#8217;m always nervous wondering &#8220;But if all these requests stop coming, then what do I do?&#8221; That&#8217;s why I wouldn&#8217;t like being misunderstood as officially being part of Crypton.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #cc2260">How World Travel Helped Expand BIGHEAD&#8217;s Horizons</span></h2>
<p><em><b>――You&#8217;ve certainly earned many opportunities to create and share music from Sapporo to the rest of the world. But how did you react to those kinds of opportunities?</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　Well, thanks to Crypton being around, I feel that even if I stayed in one place, I could still be connected to the rest of the world through them. Of course, if Miku didn&#8217;t exist, then I would have had a much harder time forming such connections.</em></p>
<p><em>But in Japan, it&#8217;s the recording companies who converge in Tokyo that put out top-notch music, and I feel like I could never produce the same results or stand on the same stage with them by my own abilities. I&#8217;d first have to level myself up, and leave my mark in the world. Of course, I&#8217;d have to abide by copyright and distribution laws.</em></p>
<p><em><b>――Last year, you indeed accomplished all sorts of activities without being limited to staying in Japan.</b></em></p>

▲BIGHEAD at Germany&#8217;s largest anime convention, <a href="https://www.dokomi.de/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DoKomi</a></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　Last year, I went to DJ in both Germany and America, and was sure surprised by all that I saw. Seriously, it was all thanks to Miku.</em></p>
<p><em>Something else that I&#8217;ve come to learn is that if you release a song on iTunes or Spotify, it can easily reach 700,000 listens in America alone; it&#8217;d be really hard to reach that many listens just in Japan. </em></p>
<p><em>The fact that one can just release a song to the world and watch it reach a super high number of listens, even without paying a fortune for advertising, is very appealing to me. That&#8217;s why I decided to write songs that feature foreign singers, adhering to songs formats that work abroad, and release them to a worldwide audience.</em></p>
<p><em><b>――By &#8220;worldwide audience,&#8221; that includes listeners in Japan as well, right?</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　Of course. I still like Japan the most, and my chief goal is to get everyone in the world more aware of music from Japan.</em></p>
<h2><span style="color: #cc2260">The &#8220;Experiment&#8221; That Bewilders CD Manufacturers</span></h2>
<p><em><b>――I&#8217;d like to asked about your third album, &#8220;<a href="https://vocadb.net/Al/24240" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Is Wide</a>,&#8221; released just last month. I was dumbfounded when I learned that in one album purchase, you don&#8217;t get 2 CDs with different songs, but rather 2 completely identical CDs with the exact same content! (laughs)</b></em></p>

<p><em><b>――It even includes instructions for something called &#8220;SHARING THE MUSIC&#8221; in which you ask buyers to give one of the CDs to someone. That&#8217;s not normal! (laughs)</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　Yeaaah&#8230; that is kind of weird, isn&#8217;t it? (laughs)</em></p>
<p><em><b>――I&#8217;ll say! (laughs) So then, how did you arrive at the idea of a &#8220;sharing CD?&#8221; This is actually what I&#8217;ve wanted to ask the most in this interview.</b></em></p>

<p>▲Instructions for the &#8220;Sharing CD&#8221;</p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　We now live in a digital age where services like Spotify enable people to listen to whatever they want, whenever they want, and practically for free. Furthermore, a person can easily send a song link from YouTube to a friend saying &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this song awesome?&#8221; and that friend will be able to open the link and listen for free. With all that in mind, a CD release seems kind of &#8220;worthless,&#8221; doesn&#8217;t it?</em></p>
<p><em>Perhaps they can find some small value in the sight of the jacket visual, or the feel of the paper pamphlet in their hands. For people who have bought my album for those reasons, I figure why not give them another one as thanks? (laughs)</em></p>
<p><em><b>――That&#8217;s a really bold idea!</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　I have limited ability when it comes to distributing my music, so I thought it&#8217;d be great to have buyers introduce it for me to people whom they are close to. Of course, it also makes CD manufacturers wonder &#8220;Was there some mistake? There are 2 of the exact same thing in here&#8230;&#8221; (laughs)</em></p>
<p><em><b>――So that means even manufacturers were bewildered. (laughs)</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　Back in the 90&#8217;s, I remember lending CDs to my friends, and giving cassette tapes and MDs to them as gifts. But now that we&#8217;re in the digital age, those kind of experiences are probably long gone.</em></p>
<p><em>Therefore, I thought how nice it would be if people could actually meet in person, and the receiver could listen to music that they were given by someone whom they&#8217;re close to, over and over again. That would mean that my music becomes part of their relationship and memories.</em></p>
<p><em><b>――So through your music, their circle of communication would expand.</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　Indeed. Even if I could play just one small part in that communication circle, I would be honored. I think that not only will the listeners of my music have their world expanded, but so too will my own world expand when they purchase and listen to my CDs. And when those listeners give the sharing CD to their friends, their world would expand was well, and so on and so forth. Thus, the &#8220;World Is Wide!&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em><b>――And the experiment results have proven to be a success, haven&#8217;t they?</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　I guess it has been pretty successful. I&#8217;m surprised by how much it has spread.</em></p>
<p><em>I asked some my friends, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to give this a try. Do you find it an interesting idea? But do you think it&#8217;ll be hard for people to get?&#8221; Responses that I got went, &#8220;I think it&#8217;d be a good thing to do, but the revenue that you earn will naturally be cut in half, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221; (laughs) But since the concept is to expand people&#8217;s worlds, I told them that this is something that I just had to do. (laughs)</em></p>
<p><em>Since I don&#8217;t work for a major recording label, this is something that I was able to decide for myself. This is one of the beauties of VOCALOID itself, letting creators make almost anything that they want. Even if I don&#8217;t know how this &#8220;experiment&#8221; will turn out, the will to carry it out forms the very nucleus of this project; losing that would be terribly tragic, which is why I knew that I had to go through with it.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;d like to pursue this ambition with a sense of haste to it, telling myself &#8220;if I fail, I quit; if I succeed, I continue on,&#8221; an option that I wouldn&#8217;t have if I worked for a major recording label.</em></p>

<p><b>――Finally, please share with us what your future plans are from here on out.</b></p>
<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　I guess my first &#8220;dream&#8221; is to see the album &#8220;World Is Wide&#8221; reach and be heard by people all over the world, and help everyone in the entire world to expand their horizons. Yes, I&#8217;m dreaming big.</em></p>
<p><em>Another one of my &#8220;dreams&#8221; would be to see a crystal bust of Miku [as she appears on the &#8220;World Is Wide&#8221; jacket illustration by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/46198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apapico</a>] collected and displayed at the <a href="https://www.moma.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MoMA</a> and other museums in the world.</em></p>
<p><em>That way, we would get to leave her mark on the world as a piece of art. If a museum collection proves to be impossible, then hopefully she can be displayed someplace else as a piece of uniquely Japanese art, which I would like to try making a reality first. Whether it&#8217;s by 3D printer or as a glass carving, I want to this idea to be physically manifested in one way or another.</em></p>
<p><em>This scale of this project means that it will probably require some crowdfunding, but I first wish to put this plan into action.</em></p>

<p><em><b>BIGHEAD</b>　I guess you&#8217;re right about that. (laughs) Next is a third &#8220;dream&#8221; of mine. Although I call it a &#8220;dream,&#8221; it&#8217;s actually something that I&#8217;ve already made some headway in.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m already in the process of constructing a system that&#8217;s capable of producing VR-compatible sounds. Progress on that is proceeding very smoothly. I&#8217;m making this because I&#8217;d like to be able to create and release PVs for songs on my own. When I think about the future, I think of 360-degree videos and sound.</em></p>
<p><em>I once released such a video whose sound would change depending on whom you&#8217;re watching; for instance, when you focus the camera on the guitar-player, the guitar track gets louder. I would like to make a new 360-degree, sound-changing video next.</em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;Writing songs at home, inputting each sound on your PC, having a VOCALOID sing it, uploading the completed song on Niconico and YouTube, announcing it on social media, watching its view count soar, and selling your CD at events like <a href="http://ketto.com/tvm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The VOC@LOiD M@STER</a> and <a href="http://www.comiket.co.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Comic Market</a>&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>VNN&#8217;s German division was able to attend Dokomi this year. Luckily, we were also able to interview <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/2733" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BIGHEAD</a> who attended Dokomi, with TANAKA who wrote the lyrics for their well known song &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/66126" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharing the World</a>&#8220;, for the Miku Expo 2014! Unfortunately, during the convention, the Dokomi interpreter didn&#8217;t have much time, so we were only able to ask a few questions. Due to time issues, part of the interview was conducted in person while the other was by email. However, please enjoy our full interview with BIGHEAD!<br />
<em>Note: The interview was conducted in Japanese. While we try to keep our translations as accurate as possible, not everything translates perfectly.<br />
</em></p>
<h3>The Interview</h3>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>First, thank you BIGHEAD for your time. It&#8217;s really nice to welcome you here in Germany! So how was Germany and Dokomi? Would you like to come to Europe again?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> At Dokomi, everything was perfect. Everyone there was enjoying the event with a fresh feeling. It made me feel that animation, manga and cosplay are advancing their own evolution rather than following Japan.</p>
<p>Unlike Paris and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nice</a>, which I visited last year, the deep clouds and the beautiful cityscape here have given me some inspiration. I think that I&#8217;ll also be able to create new songs influenced by my experiences in Germany. I&#8217;d like to come back to Europe soon.</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>That&#8217;s nice to hear! So I guess we could start with our actual interview if you don&#8217;t mind. So how did you discover VOCALOID at first?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> I&#8217;ve seen this Google ad, the &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/8395" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tell Your World</a>&#8221; video and was very moved by it.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MGt25mv4-2Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>It&#8217;s well known today, isn&#8217;t it? Did you have any experience in writing music prior to VOCALOID?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> I&#8217;ve been playing in a band since my days in school, high school, that is, and recorded stuff in a recording studio later on.</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>Which instrument did you play? Do you still play it?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> At the start, I played the guitar, then the bass, and in my college days, I was playing the drums all the time. When making songs with <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hatsune Miku</a>, I still record the bass and guitar by myself, and my drumming experience is useful when programming drums. My past involvement with music is certainly helping.</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>Only after being in VOCALOID and producing for some time, did you change your producer name to BIGHEAD. Where does this alias come from and what does it mean?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> The person I love has a rather big head &#8211; and that&#8217;s where &#8220;BIGHEAD&#8221; came from.</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>Haha, that&#8217;s a lovely choice! So, what we were also wondering, unlike other Japanese producers, you write a lot of English songs. What inspired you to write mainly songs with English lyrics?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> There was a &#8220;Western Music Boom&#8221; during the time I was in high school. I&#8217;ve listened to nothing but Western Music, so I wanted to make stuff like that. I thought that it would be good and common.</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>And you are indeed appreciated in the west for your work! A lot of Spanish-speaking people love the Spanish version of &#8220;Sharing the World&#8221;. What do you think about it, and about how other songs are translated into different languages?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> I&#8217;m honored that &#8220;Sharing The World&#8221; is played in various countries, but it is surprising that it has been covered in Spanish, Chinese, and even more languages! I receive a lot of emails every month saying &#8220;Please release this&#8221; from Mexican fans.  I hope that &#8220;Sharing The World&#8221; will continue to expand all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>You&#8217;ve used <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/958" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miku&#8217;s English V3</a> and her <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/49724" target="_blank" rel="noopener">English V4</a>. Which do you think is better, V3 or V4?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> For Japanese, V2 is Number 1. After that, I use V4 frequently. With V4, I think that the possibilities of expression and choices are expanded. As for English, I like V3 in the part of pronunciation and rhythm, so I mainly use v3.</p>
<p>I was planning to say that at the Dokomi workshop, that it is effective to use V3 and V4 in combination for harmony parts. I wanted to tell everyone more, but, in the workshop, there were a lot of enthusiastic questions and it was so exciting I couldn&#8217;t fit everything in.</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>Are you planning on using other VOCALOIDs in the future?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> I&#8217;ve met Joffrey from <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this French company</a> here at Dokomi, so I decided to make something, and he and I can work on it together.</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>What do you think about the VOCALOID characters and their personalities? Is it the composer who makes their personality? And for the composer, who is part of the fandom, will public opinion of the fandom form the composer&#8217;s opinion on a character?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> I do not think that VOCALOIDs themselves have personalities. VOCALOIDs are colorless and transparent, so composers and listeners can self-project. But the composer cannot make the personality of a VOCALOID, because the personality of VOCALOID is by everyone. I like how that part is hard and can not be handled. However, it isn&#8217;t difficult to share VOCALOID content. By using VOCALOID, &#8220;Sharing The World&#8221; becomes easy!</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>How was it to cooperate with other artists when making <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/150365">&#8220;OISHII&#8221; TRIP</a>?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> Composer <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/57113">Oguro</a> and lyricist <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/57112">Aoyama</a> have profound knowledge about VOCALOID, so we were able to produce smoothly. I have enjoyed it thanks to the experience collaborating with <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/2434">EmpathP</a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/919">CircusP</a> and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/25588">ROBO</a> for the first time. Also, this time I was very happy that customers shook hands and raised their voices when playing &#8220;OISHII&#8221; TRIP at Dokomi&#8217;s DJ event.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZuAiTiExIPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>Do you have any advice for fans who are getting started in producing and are becoming successful?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> After about a year after I started making VOCALOID songs, my first song was selected for a Lady Gaga concert. You never know what can happen, so if you happen to come across a huge chance like that, have the courage to meet the challenge.</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>Is there anything else you would like to say to your fans?</em></p>
<p><strong>BIGHEAD:</strong> I like to take part in events like Dokomi and want to communicate with people from all over the world, so I&#8217;d like to thank all the people I&#8217;ve met in this country.</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong> <em>Thank you for your time! Hopefully we&#8217;ll see you again soon in Europe and have fun at Anime Next!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fourth LUMi creators interview was recently released for all to read! It&#8217;s an interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/shotarock_p" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shotaro Kaizuka</a> of <a href="http://columbia.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nippon Columbia</a> and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/41844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bunta</a>, the creator of “Yoake no Uta”, about the official demo song. While the two discuss the song and it&#8217;s creation, they also give even more insight into LUMi as well. So we&#8217;re able to learn about LUMi&#8217;s world as well her her demo.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t listened to the demo yet, be sure to check it out!</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F327967195&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=618&#038;maxheight=927"></iframe></p>
<h3>LUMi, a VOCALOID with a Firmly-Established Canon</h3>
<p>Shotaro Kaizuka personally finds LUMi very different from other VOCALOIDs. While many different VOCALOIDs have sprung up from the culture surrounding NND, many aren&#8217;t as in-depth as LUMi. She&#8217;s treated like an actual character with a personality and backstory. While many VOCALOIDs are given personalities and the like, none have been as in-depth as LUMi&#8217;s story. According to Kaizuka, &#8220;It’s almost like we were creating an animated film out of her, first establishing the story material, and then coming up with the soundtrack&#8221;. Rather than feeling like he was making a demo song, he felt like he was creating the main theme of a movie soundtrack.</p>
<p>In addition, Bunta noted LUMi is his favorite VOCALOID. While he owns ten of them, he feels that LUMi has the most gentle and pure voice.</p>
<p>Kaizuka continues on noting how important LUMi&#8217;s backstory is. He says that it gives people the chance to think of LUMi in ways they wouldn&#8217;t have before. However, unlike many, he doesn&#8217;t see the backstory as limiting. He feels this new way of thinking will allow even more range of creativity.</p>
<h3>Creating “Yoake no Uta”</h3>
<p>Both Bunta and Kaizuka said that creating a song, or anything, doesn&#8217;t come easily. Both note they make songs for the listener more than themselves. While they personally may like something, they agree that it&#8217;s still no good if the listeners don&#8217;t like it. Bunta personally puts a strong emphasis on what he wants to convey when he writes. However, he also feels that he&#8217;s not just that as he also writes music based on what people want to hear and not necessarily completely what he wants.</p>
<h4>Waves Are Not in 4/4 Time</h4>
<p>Kaizuka actually joined in the production of the song when it was almost complete. However, with his help, the song became what it is now. He advised that the string instruments be redone.</p>
<p>According to Kaizuka, the group wasn&#8217;t even sure what instruments they should be record for the song. But when he heard that LUMi’s story was set in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamakura" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kamakura</a>, he was able to find some direction. He imagined the scenery as daybreak on an early summer day, with the sound of waves crashing in the distance. Then he imagined how that kind of scenery could translate into a piano phrase as he listened to the song itself.</p>
<p>When he heard the song’s demo for the first time, he wondered if it would suffice as an original song. He considered a rhythm change and when the song changed enough that he started thinking, “Now THIS would work as LUMi’s signature song!”, hestarted to wonder if the song didn&#8217;t necessarily have to all be in 4/4 time.</p>
<p>There are moments when the rhythm changes between 6/8 time and 5/8 time to give the sense of &#8220;waves&#8221;. After all, waves are dynamic and are always changing. Kaizuka thought that the piano parts should reflect this.</p>
<p>They went on to record drum, bass, and guitar parts afterwards. At first, they started with the drum and bass parts, then recorded the piano parts to go on top of them. But, at one point, Kaizuka suggested that playing and recording all three together may improve the song slightly. Bunta and Kaizuka both agree this vastly improved the song.</p>
<h4>The Theme</h4>
<p>At first, the song was themed around words like “ocean floor” and “harbor.” But, afterwards, rather than thinking along similar terms like “bubbles” or “water,” the theme of the song started to change to “space.” Bunta felt that having the song theme around “space” would fit Yoshizawa-san’s image of the song much better. Furthermore, the recording sessions were eventually moved to a much wider and more spacious studio, which changed the sound of the recordings. That meant it wasn’t just the theme, but even the studio that changed to fit the new direction of the song.</p>
<h3>Hopes for LUMi</h3>
<p>Bunta notes that he hopes people will start to use LUMi as their primary VOCALOID. He thinks she’s amazing with her pure and gentle voice, and her ability to pronounce every single sound, including diphones and triphones.</p>
<p>As for Kaizuka, he hopes to see LUMi perform. He&#8217;d like to see LUMI in something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isao_Tomita" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Isao Tomita’s</a> <a href="http://www.mikufan.com/hatsune-miku-x-tomita-isao-symphony-ihatov-to-be-held-in-beijing-on-may-20th" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Symphony IHATOV”</a>, a live entertainment show in which <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hatsune Miku</a> appeared in the orchestra to sing and dance. He felt like this was the complete package. According to him, people have been saying for years that the way in which we enjoy and consume music is going through a period of change. He thinks that if this is so, that LUMi should the one who introduces us to new ways of enjoying and consuming music.</p>
<h3>Advice for Creators</h3>
<p>Finally, the two were asked what advice they had for people who want to start creating music.</p>
<p>Bunta said to just give it a try. Just start off by making one song then, before long, you’ll make lots more. Create songs that you yourself love and the work to create songs that others will love. Because, after all, creating something you think is a masterpiece means nothing if your listeners don&#8217;t like it.</p>
<p>Kaizuka suggests that you have to have a good balance of input as well as output. He thinks that balance would be really difficult to attain if you only listen to music that you discover online. And, while he admits it’s true that VOCALOID software is convenient for lending vocals to your music, it comes with its own risk: if you only ever write VOCALOID songs, then you’ll never get to experience what it’s like to direct an actual singer. He stresses the importance of listening to lots of music in all different genres. A large amount of a variety of music is key.</p>
<p>He also suggests that you spend time listening to one single song over and over again with reasonably good audio. If you listen very closely and earnestly, then you’ll be able to discover something new each and every time. You can then add those discoveries to your own personal repertoire of musical knowledge, helping to strike that balance mentioned above.</p>
<p>He says it’s fine if you decide that the VOCALOID realm will be your primary battleground, but he believes that you should someday also learn to work with actual singers. He notes that other important points to keep in mind are practicing your step recording, practicing actual band ensembles, working with people who are adept at reading music scores, and, most importantly, always keeping an open mind about anything and everything.</p>

<p>The surprise announcement came due to news of Microsoft announcing that they plan to remove MS Paint from Windows 10 this Fall, after being included in every version of Windows for the past 32 years. After hearing the public feedback, Microsoft said they will provide the application again via Microsoft Store download.</p>
<p>Knowing this special detail behind the production of Hello Planet’s music video makes us further appreciate just how much work went into making such a memorable masterpiece. You can watch the music video from Sasakure.UK’s official channel below!</p>
