<p>You may have not heard of it yet but <strong>NEUTRINO</strong> is a voice synthesizer that uses a neural network as its primary framework, created by <strong>SHACHI</strong>.</p>
<p>Features like timing, pitch, voice quality, and blurring of voice from music score are all created using this neural network. Speech is synthesized by a vocoder based on the aforementioned estimated paramaters.</p>
<p>AI and Moto Neural Network (NN) based singing voice synthesis uses music information to <span class="marker-under">find out what timing/pitch/voice quality/voices</span> will be and then vocoders it.</p>
<p>And the best of all? <strong>NEUTRINO</strong> is free to use thanks to it being freeware!</p>
<h3><strong>NEUTRINO&#8217;s Key Components</strong></h3>
<p>This software identifies itself as &#8220;<strong><em>Natural and Smooth</em></strong>&#8221; where its features are directly extracted from the data obtained of the singers and their songs. It is able to reproduce not only the voice quality of the singer, but also all of their characteristics like tonality and singing habits.</p>
<p>It is also very easy to &#8220;<strong>Install and Use</strong>&#8220;. Just open the lyrics and melodies that you like and the software will do the rest. It&#8217;s almost as if you were producing songs with a real actual singer! With just one click, you&#8217;ll be able to set up the software for all your musical needs.</p>
<p>Start quick and enjoy a world you&#8217;ve never seen before with this revolutionary vocal synthetizer!</p>
<h3><strong>NEUTRINO&#8217;s Singer Library</strong></h3>
<p>As of February 2020, there are two singers available in <strong>NEUTRINO</strong>. These are called <strong>Tohoku Kiritan</strong> and <strong>Yoko </strong>which you can check out below:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having a boring weekend, guys? No need to worry, because <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/48697">Quadimension</a> is always thinking of us!</p>
<p>In the past two days, the team upload <em>two</em> new videos to their Bilibili channel. Each one introduces songs that are worth your ears&#8217; time!</p>
<h3>A Renewed Version of &#8220;Qǐ Wù Yuán&#8221;!</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin with a song that we know, but got an updated version: &#8220;<a href="https://vocadb.net/S/249549">Qǐ Wù Yuán</a>&#8221; by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/9724">MeLo</a> with lyrics by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/46962">绿邪</a>, sung by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/35966">Stardust</a> and <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/70235">CangQiong</a> and released on their album titled &#8220;<a href="https://vocadb.net/Al/26831">天方夜谭Fairyland</a>&#8220;.</p>
<figure id="attachment_240422" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-240422" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-240422" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/42ae97bd97bc51b844e799043ad248396e83a49b-1024x640.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="600" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/42ae97bd97bc51b844e799043ad248396e83a49b-1024x640.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/42ae97bd97bc51b844e799043ad248396e83a49b-300x187.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/42ae97bd97bc51b844e799043ad248396e83a49b-800x500.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/42ae97bd97bc51b844e799043ad248396e83a49b.jpg 1900w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-240422" class="wp-caption-text">Click on this picture to open the video on Bilibili! If it doesn&#8217;t work, click <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/av63822659">here</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This song is one we&#8217;ve all heard before. But, if you recall the original video&#8217;s description, it wasn&#8217;t made using CangQiong&#8217;s <strong>Synthesizer V library</strong>!</p>
<p>Fortunately for us, the new version showcases her newly finished voice bank on said engine, so we recommend you listen to it by clicking on the video above!</p>
<h3>A Spotlight for the Diva of the Sea with &#8220;Moonlight Palm&#8221;!</h3>
<p>Next, we give pass the baton to <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/63844">HaiYi</a>, who just had another song published today! We can now enjoy one of the original tracks from her album &#8220;<a href="https://vocadb.net/Al/25781">亚特兰蒂斯Atlantis</a>&#8220;: &#8220;<a href="https://vocadb.net/S/211542?albumId=25781">Moonlight Palm</a>&#8221; by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/6041">Zeno</a>!</p>
<figure id="attachment_240436" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-240436" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-240436 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/c3d4540dfaa3a6be21d558ead2a5b2f06a0a05fe.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="600" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/c3d4540dfaa3a6be21d558ead2a5b2f06a0a05fe.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/c3d4540dfaa3a6be21d558ead2a5b2f06a0a05fe-300x188.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/c3d4540dfaa3a6be21d558ead2a5b2f06a0a05fe-800x500.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-240436" class="wp-caption-text">Click on this picture to open the video on Bilibili! If it doesn&#8217;t work, click <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/av64037779">here</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Once again, we were amazed by her voice and how well it flowed with Zeno&#8217;s style. <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/15357">Napstina</a>&#8216;s tuning gives her a unique liveliness in this track that helps illustrate just how strong and distinctive her vocal is. </p>
<p>Knowing HaiYi will join her sisters on <strong>Synthesizer V</strong> soon, we can&#8217;t wait to hear more! While we wait for more updates on her, let&#8217;s listen to this her together! Click on the picture above to open the video!</p>
<p>Are you all excited for the upcoming Medium⁵ virtual divas, original songs and albums? Which characters are your favorite, and what are the songs you&#8217;re enjoying the most? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Chinese developer Boxstar announced a brand new synthesis software tonight, say hello to &#8220;DeepVocal&#8221;!</p>
<h3>A Brand New Beginning!</h3>
<p>So much time has passed since the last time we talked about Sharpkey, the synthesis engine developed by Boxstar and released a few years ago. After so much time, however, he decided to start over his project with a brand new engine named &#8220;DeepVocal&#8221;, and he gave s a small peak of it via Weibo tonight!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">(1/3)International Virtual Singers Project: DeepVocal is now ready for beta!<br />Link is the raw monopitch vocal sample<br />To try out beta，2 steps:<br />1. follow <a href="https://twitter.com/boxstar_hx?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@boxstar_hx</a> in Twitter to get the latest updates</p>
<p>&mdash; boxstar (@boxstar_hx) <a href="https://twitter.com/boxstar_hx/status/1136897687612207104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">(3/3)Note: I will also accept emails from previous <br />SharpkeyGalaxy applications <a href="https://t.co/wcrD2lAfag">pic.twitter.com/wcrD2lAfag</a></p>
<p>&mdash; boxstar (@boxstar_hx) <a href="https://twitter.com/boxstar_hx/status/1136897692968394752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Judging from what is shown through the video, DeepVocal features a renewed GUI, much more similar to the VOCALOID editor&#8217;s one, and shows off a tool that allows voice library&#8217;s editing.<br />
We can clearly see the tool being a much more easier setting method compared to UTAU&#8217;s well known oto.ini one, as we can have a glimpse on recording&#8217;s frequencies at ease when editing each sample&#8217;s settings.</p>
<p>Even though the editor&#8217;s GUI is shown in its Chinese language, we can assume from the voice library editing tool that it also supports English.</p>
<p>Boxstar also announced that a closed beta will start globally next month, The application method is very easy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow his <a href="https://twitter.com/boxstar_hx">Twitter account</a> for news and updates</li>
<li>Send him an e-mail to boxstar@foxmail.com, attaching a one minute long introduction video of your virtual singer and your future plans about it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Application are open to everyone, no matter the country or the language, and he will get back to you in a month or so.</p>
<h3>Sources</h3>
<p>So, what do you think? Will you join the hype rain and submit your application for DeepVocal&#8217;s closed beta? If so, hope you enjoy testing it out!</p>

<h3>Little Little MEDIUM⁵ Pendants!</h3>
<p>The fact that Quadimension promotes their characters shouldn&#8217;t be big news for any fan that follows them closely, but ChiYu had no appearance in them so far, at least until now!</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Yes, you are reading it right ChiYu fans! Their pendants series will soon feature her as well!</p>
<p>Those two sets (Chibi version in the left, Dragon Boat Festival version in the right) will cost 70 RMB each, while a single pendant will only cost 18 RMB.</p>

<p>ChiYu isn&#8217;t the only thing we got revealed today! Do you recognized this song? It&#8217;s the same one used for <a href="/vocal-sample-of-quadimensions-synthesizer-v-chiyu-published/">her previous vocal sample</a>. We now finally know its lyrics, title and author. It is titled &#8220;<a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/72386">翡夜Racing Game</a>&#8221; (&#8220;Fěi yè Racing Game&#8221;) and was composed by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/6041">Zeno</a> for our new fire maiden&#8217;s introduction. Her voice is filled with power, bringing us a sharp and memorable voice to Synthesizer V&#8217;s Virtual Singers&#8217; cast.</p>
<p>Her design and illustration were revealed today as well and they were made by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/57808">Hanasa</a>, <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/57809">ATDan</a> and <strong>Kurumimi</strong>. ChiYu&#8217;s outfit is exactly what we would expect for such a powerful vocalist, inspired by fire, and we cannot wait for her to make even more appearances in the future!</p>
<h3>Pre-Orders</h3>
<p>ChiYu&#8217;s voicebank, as we previously confirmed not long ago, is running in the Synthesizer V engine made by <strong>Dreamtonics</strong>, and she is up for pre-order now! her voice library is available in both digital and physical version through Quadimension&#8217;s Taobao store and comes in bundle with SynthV&#8217;s editor.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-217275 size-medium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/O1CN015eiELy1OTOCq9mfx7_678151706-300x188.png" alt="" width="300" height="188" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/O1CN015eiELy1OTOCq9mfx7_678151706-300x188.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/04/O1CN015eiELy1OTOCq9mfx7_678151706-800x500.png 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/04/O1CN015eiELy1OTOCq9mfx7_678151706.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Her release date is scheduled to be on April 30th for the digital version, which is priced 500 RMB and includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Synthesizer V Editor Installer;</li>
<li>ChiYu&#8217;s voice library installer and serial number;</li>
<li>User manual and installation guide;</li>
<li>Physical shipping of the code to your home (in Mainland China&#8217;s territory, and will require an extra fee).</li>
</ol>
<p>The physical version will begin shipping on late May, instead, and is priced 598 RMB. You can pre-order ChiYu&#8217;s chinese voicebank <a href="https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=592049253199">here</a>.</p>
<p>However, those prices are only a limited time offer, as ChiYu&#8217;s voicebank will cost 680 RMB at the end of this discount, so you better order her as soon as you can!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we discovered that <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/72386"><em>ChiYu</em></a>, the latest addition to the <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/48697">Quadimension</a>&#8216;s MEDIUM⁵ cast, is confirmed to be running on the Synthesizer V engine. Now, only few hours apart from her vocal sample becoming public, we got another demo song!</p>
<h3>New Short Demo Song</h3>
<p>While her previous vocal sample was only meant to give us a glimpse of her voice type, this new short demo song published by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/34370">KIDE</a> shows ChiYu&#8217;s vocal at its finest. You can listen to it via Bilibili below!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/av49054605" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-216872 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chrome_2019-04-12_11-54-18.png" alt="" width="1086" height="699" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chrome_2019-04-12_11-54-18.png 1086w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chrome_2019-04-12_11-54-18-300x193.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chrome_2019-04-12_11-54-18-1024x659.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chrome_2019-04-12_11-54-18-800x515.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1086px) 100vw, 1086px" /></a></p>

<p>ChiYu certainly does have a more sharp tone compared to her fellow MEDIUM⁵ members. This gives her a more peculiar role on the group and definitely fits her fire element quite a lot.</p>
