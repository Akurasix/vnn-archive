					<description><![CDATA[<p>This year, VoxWave attended Dokomi in Germany! And, of course, it wouldn&#8217;t be a full VoxWave party without The Baka Kitsune (TBK), Co-Founder of VoxWave, Youtaite, and voice provider of LEORA.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VoxWave</a> attended Dokomi in Germany! And, of course, it wouldn&#8217;t be a full VoxWave party without <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16693" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Baka Kitsune (TBK)</a>, Co-Founder of VoxWave, Youtaite, and voice provider of <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/51585" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LEORA</a>. The German division of VNN was lucky enough to be able to ask her a few questions about everything she&#8217;s involved in. Here&#8217;s VNN&#8217;s interview with TBK!</p>
<h3>The Interview</h3>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong><em> How are you enjoying Dokomi and Germany so far?</em></p>
<p><strong>TBK:</strong> It&#8217;s really great! I came to Germany for the last time five years ago, so I was really happy to be able to come back here. It&#8217;s a great time and opportunity to practice my German, too!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong><em> Is there anything you personally want to say to your fans?</em></p>
<p><strong>TBK:</strong> Keep loving virtual singers! This team is awesome, okay? And keep doing what you like in life. Everything is good, everything is great!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>Regarding your recent work on LEORA, how was recording for you?</em></p>
<p><strong>TBK:</strong> I already did record an UTAU before, my UTAU <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16694" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guren Nataku</a>, so I was kinda used to the process. But it was also different with LEORA because we wanted it to be really precise and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16843" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drak-pa</a> kept telling me to re-record samples because we needed to have the phoneme sounds to be really precise and specific. So it was a bit longer. We took like an entire weekend to record the French and I still have to record the English, which will be the hardest part, but I really enjoyed it!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty surprised because LEORA actually has a beautiful high lyrical voice and really beautiful high notes, and I just have recorded a medium voice range, so I&#8217;m kinda confused. I have no idea where they come from, but it&#8217;s cool because it&#8217;s kinda complimentary? I can&#8217;t sing high notes very well and she can sing them for me, which is really cool.</p>

<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/leora.png'><img width="712" height="475" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/leora.png" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/leora.png 712w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/leora-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px" /></a>

<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>What was your first reaction when you heard LEORA for the first time?<br />
</em><br />
<strong>TBK:</strong> Joffrey told me, &#8220;Oh, I can hear your voice in LEORA,&#8221; and I was like, &#8220;Oh, really?&#8221; because I&#8217;m so used to my raw natural voice during the recording process, so it feels completely different for me to hear it through a voice synthesizer. I really don&#8217;t see LEORA as a copy of my voice, really not! I think it&#8217;s a new being, a new entity. It&#8217;s really interesting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>How would you describe the relationship between LEORA and ALYS?<br />
</em><br />
<strong>TBK:</strong> We made LEORA as kind of an &#8220;Alter/Ego,&#8221; if I can say it like that, of <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ALYS</a> so that she can be everything you want her to be! Some people see them as lovers, others as best friends or even enemies. I personally see it as they&#8217;re from the same world, so they&#8217;re just here together. I like all of the things that they can do together?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>And how would you describe YOUR personal relationship with LEORA?<br />
</em><br />
<strong>TBK:</strong> Uhm, that&#8217;s a hard one. I see her like she is a part of me. She&#8217;s everything I can&#8217;t do in public. I like to see her as a warrior, as a berserker, and a strong woman! Sometimes I&#8217;m angry and I can&#8217;t really publicly say, &#8220;I want to destroy it!&#8221; But I feel like LEORA has this attitude where she would say it. I like her; she is my girl, my fighting girl. She&#8217;s our girl with VoxWave and everyone&#8217;s girl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>If you could say something to LEORA in person, what would that be?</em></p>
<p><strong>TBK:</strong> Never give up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>Would you like to perform some day with her side by side?</em></p>
<p><strong>TBK:</strong> Yes, definitely! To be honest, I already asked Joffrey to do a duet song with LEORA because I really think it would be great and, as I said, she has beautiful high notes. So I think I can do the low parts and she can take over the high parts. I really want to try it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>What do you wish for LEORA in the future?</em></p>
<p><strong>TBK:</strong> I hope that people will welcome her just like they did with ALYS. She isn&#8217;t here to replace ALYS; she&#8217;s here to help her! She&#8217;s here to bring forth a new part of their universe. So I really hope people will enjoy LEORA and make songs with her. I just want her to bring something to people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/192">AHS</a> now has quite a reputation for creating successful VOCALOID concerts in <a href="/concerts-a-figure-and-other-yuzuki-yukari-merchandise-announced/">Japan; Berlin, Germany;</a> and Vienna, Austria! This year, AHS will return to Berlin, however, the concert will feature only VOCALOIDs. Yuzuki Yukari&#8217;s voice provider, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/53358">Chihiro Ishiguro</a>, won&#8217;t be at the show. The news was met with some displeasure from both the fans and Chihiro herself.</p>
<p>This is the reason why Michael Klement of Anime Kultur Verein <em>(German for &#8220;Anime Culture Society&#8221;),</em> who also organized Anime Messe Berlin, has started a Kickstarter campaign to get both Chihiro Ishiguro and the musician <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/323">EHAMIC</a> at the show. EHAMIC has produced multiple songs for Chihiro to be on site at this year&#8217;s convention. The convention is being held from June 23rd to the 25th at the <a href="https://www.animemesse.de/#location">KOSMOS</a> in Berlin, Germany.</p>
<h3>What is the Anime Kultur Verein?</h3>
<p>The Anime Kultur Verein was founded in 2014 by 20 anime and manga fans/friends in Berlin, and has been trying ever since to bring more of the anime, manga, and Japanese Pop culture to Germany. Last year, they organized the first VOCALOID concert in Germany featuring AHS on the huge stage at Anime Messe Berlin.</p>
<p>Since last year the concert was held on Friday and not all fans were able to attend, this year they managed to have the concert on Saturday of the convention (June 24th). This way, more people may be able to attend.</p>
<p>In collaboration with AHS, they were able to confirm the concert for the convention as well as acquire the equipment needed. The problem is that Chihiro Ishiguro would like to perform along with her VOCALOID on stage, together with the live music by EHAMIC.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3f1qX6ozMr8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>A link to the Kickstarter can be found <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1826512733/chihiro-ishiguro-and-ehamic-konzert-auf-der-anime/">here</a> as well as at the end of the article.</p>
<p>The goal of the Kickstarter is to enable Anime Messe Berlin to pay for the travel cost and accommodation expenses (which is €4000 EUR) for both guests. In addition to that, they would like to be able to perform at the concert on Saturday. They also hope to have their own concert on Sunday. Please note that AHS is not directly involved in the Kickstarter and this is being done entirely by Anime Kultur Verein.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I (Monds) received a copy of <em>IA/03 VISION</em> and <em>Lia COLLECTION ALBUM Vol.2 [Crystal Voice]</em>, both of which are well worth a review. Since IA&#8217;s album consists of three CDs and a DVD, and Lia&#8217;s album consists of two CDs, I will go over them one by one.</p>
<h2><em><a href="http://vocadb.net/Al/9676">IA/03 VISION</a></em></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-59680" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0849-1024x768.jpg" alt="img_0849" width="618" height="464" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0849-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0849-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0849.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></p>
<p>Let me begin by saying that if you are an <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/504">IA</a> fan, then this album is a must-have no matter where you find it. It is jam-packed with some of the greatest IA songs out there. To top it off, each CD offers a different style that is bound to please anyone no matter what style of music you enjoy. It also has a very nice glossy box&#8230; we all love those!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-59746" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0878-1024x768.jpg" alt="img_0878" width="618" height="464" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0878-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0878-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0878.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></p>
<h3>GOLD (Disc 1)</h3>
<p>The songs included on this disc are more fast-paced and have some great bass to add to it. As someone who is a fan of faster songs, this disc is the one I find myself listening to the most. Not only that but also it doesn&#8217;t stick to one style either; it is quite varied from one song to the next. Some of the songs on the album such as &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/68057">We gotta run</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/69161">Shooting Star</a>&#8221; were among the songs I already enjoyed. However, I found myself discovering and enjoying others too, such as &#8220;<a title="Kimera, Chimera" href="http://vocadb.net/S/69167?albumId=9676">キメラ</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a title="" href="http://vocadb.net/S/69168?albumId=9676">Waiting for…</a>&#8220;, as these songs are up-beat with some nice pounding bass. I recommend listening to this disc with a nice set of headphones or some great speakers with a subwoofer or two for the best experience. Don&#8217;t be afraid to turn up the bass on this one! I found myself listening to this disc many times over.</p>
<h3>SILVER (Disc 2)</h3>
<p>This disc seems to be more geared towards soft rock/hard rock songs, in which case I also enjoy quite a bit, so I would consider this one to be second of the three. This album includes songs such as &#8220;<a title="" href="http://vocadb.net/S/56821?albumId=9676">Inner Arts</a>&#8220;, which is more of a mid-rock song, and &#8220;<a title="" href="http://vocadb.net/S/69173?albumId=9676">ZERO BLADE</a>&#8220;, which is a heavier song. Don&#8217;t worry if heavier is not your thing, since there is a mix of softer songs for those of you who think the others may have too much going on, like &#8220;<a title="Kuusou Fantasia" href="http://vocadb.net/S/71588?albumId=9676">空奏ファンタジア</a>&#8220;. To add to the spice, the last song &#8220;<a title="Santa Clause no Baka Yarou, Fuck You Santa Clause" href="http://vocadb.net/S/47061?albumId=9676">サンタクロースのバカヤロウ</a>&#8221; is more or less a Christmas song with &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221; being said at the beginning. Although, I say more or less since the song is not as much of a happy-go-lucky song like your typical Christmas carol. Not bad by any means, just an interesting twist. For all you &#8220;Vocarock&#8221; fans out there, this disc is the one for you.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-59735" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0874-1024x768.jpg" alt="img_0874" width="618" height="464" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0874-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0874-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0874.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></p>
<h3>WHITE (disc 3)</h3>
<p>This disc would be my least favorite and I say this lightly. The reason for this is only a preference, this by does not mean I do not like it. I do enjoy a variety of music but there are some I prefer over others. This disc consists of songs mostly in the Pop genre of music in which I tend to listen to less often. I will admit that I still found myself bobbing my head to some catchy tunes along the way and I definitely will listen to them several times. It definitely gives a more happy vibe over all, perfect for anyone who needs a little &#8220;happy boost&#8221; in their day. Especially the song &#8220;<a title="Hotarubi Satellite, Light of a Firefly Satellite" href="http://vocadb.net/S/69179?albumId=9676">蛍火サテライト</a>&#8221; that has IA singing in a cute voice instead of the more mature voice that most of us are used to hearing, although different, it is a welcome change to show off IA&#8217;s capabilities in many styles of music.</p>
<h3>BLACK (DVD)</h3>
<p>Unlike the others, this one contains high-quality music videos of the songs &#8220;We gotta run&#8221;, &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/42498">Setsuna Drive</a>&#8220;, and &#8220;Inner Art&#8221;. If you are like me, music videos are as much part of the fun as the music itself. Most VOCALOID fans can admit that seeing them perform whether on a music video or on stage, or even having any sort of video/artwork definitely makes it a greater experience. More specifically, &#8220;We gotta run&#8221;, since not only do we see IA in this video but also highlights from the Super GT races — a perfect match for any IA and car lovers out there. Let&#8217;s be honest. What VOCALOID fan wouldn&#8217;t want to race a fast car featuring their favorite VOCALOID as visuals? It also showcases other aspect, such as their dancers.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry though. If you do not have the album, you can also watch it on 1st PLACE&#8217;s official YouTube channel!</p>

<h3>Extras</h3>
<p>Of course, that isn&#8217;t everything. You didn&#8217;t think an album with so much content wouldn&#8217;t come with some goods, did you? The album comes with four postcards included, a very nice booklet that includes the lyrics for each song (in Japanese), and information on the artists involved, including some of their social media accounts. So if you enjoy the producer, then you will be able to find them on places such as Twitter! Also in the booklet are some amazing artwork, as no booklet is complete without some beautiful artwork, in this case of IA. The DVD also includes a 30-day trial of IA ROCKS -ARIA ON THE PLANETES- as well as some short clips.</p>

<p>To finish off, I was lucky enough to get Lia to sign the album for me!</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/PCCA-90030">Lia COLLECTION ALBUM Vol.2 [Crystal Voice]</a></em></h2>
<p>If we are going to talk about VOCALOID, we need to mention their voice provider as well. After all, they deserve recognition too, since without them, we would have no VOCALOID voice to enjoy. <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/655">Lia</a> is very much involved with IA and performs live shows with her, so it&#8217;s always great to see the two sing along together.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-59724" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0863-1024x768.jpg" alt="img_0863" width="464" height="348" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0863-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0863-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0863.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" /></p>
<p>This album comes with two CDs. It is a compilation CD after all — the more songs, the better!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-59713" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0862-1024x768.jpg" alt="img_0862" width="547" height="411" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0862-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0862-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0862.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px" /></p>
<p>Let me begin by saying that if you don&#8217;t know Lia, not only is she the voice provider of IA and a singer, but also she is famous for singing songs in anime such as <em>Clannad</em> and the famous <em>Angel Beats</em> opening song, &#8220;My Soul, Your Beats!&#8221;, which also has a version of IA singing it.</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ext.nicovideo.jp/thumb_watch/sm17089385?w=490&h=307"></script><noscript><a href="https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm17089385">NicoNico</a></noscript>
Of course, this is only to name a few, as she has many more on her list. Now, if you like IA, then you will love Lia as well — after all, she is her voice provider. Lia sings some softer songs on this album, but overall, she has a very soft and beautiful voice, in which case the softer/slower songs are definitely a good combination. Before this album, I will admit that I had heard of Lia but not a lot of her songs, but after listening to these two CDs, I wish I had sooner. Her singing is wonderful and quite relaxing. Not only does she sing in Japanese on the albums but also in English as well! Actually, Lia is quite fluent in English and she can sing just as well in English as Japanese, so if listening to songs in Japanese is not your thing, you can also listen to her in English. I assure you that you will not be disappointed. If you feel like listening to some nice, calm, and soothing music, then I would say Lia and this album is definitely something I highly recommend. If anyone ever has a chance to go see her live whether it be with IA or Lia on her own, by all means, take the opportunity!</p>
<p>Lastly, a special thanks to Lia for the signature on this one as well.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If you are a fan of IA, Lia, or both, then this is a perfect gift for yourself or even another fan. If you are not familiar with IA or Lia, and any of the above seems of interest to you, you should check out some of the songs on the album to have a feel for it. There is definitely something for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>You can still purchase <em>IA/03 Vision</em> on CDJapan, Amazon, and probably other places.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the weekend, I (Monds) spent the bigger part of mine at Anime North, and let me tell you, I had a great time at this event! Anyone who can attend should definitely try to do so next year. Although I spent over 30+ hours at the convention with very little sleep over a period of three days and was exhausted, I would and will do it all over again. Of course, that&#8217;s what cons are all about, are they not? That being said, let&#8217;s go over my experience during the convention.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/anime-north.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-7589 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/anime-north-1024x570.jpg" alt="anime north" width="663" height="369" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/anime-north-1024x570.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/05/anime-north-300x167.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/05/anime-north-1100x612.jpg 1100w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/05/anime-north.jpg 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px" /></a></p>
<h2>Panel</h2>
<p>Although Kotori could not make it due to an unfortunate event, I led the panel by myself. Of course, that didn&#8217;t stop my excitement once I got to the panel door and saw a long line of people ready to come see my panel. Due to being the only VOCALOID panel at Anime North, I wasn&#8217;t sure how much interest it would get — however, it exceeded my expectations. The panel room was filled, but unfortunately, not everyone was able to make it in. The subject of our panel was &#8220;The history and culture of VOCALOID&#8221;, and I figured it would be a great subject since a lot of people aren&#8217;t familiar with the vast amount of VOCALOIDs out there, let alone how it all began. Here, I discussed the beginning of the software, the rise in popularity of VOCALOID, and the beginning of Hatsune Miku, as well as where VOCALOID is today, multiple languages that VOCALOIDs can sing in, plus a sample of each one. I also threw in some interesting facts along the way. Lastly, the panel ended with a little Q&amp;A during the last few minutes. I had some pins to give away for which the entire room got up for pretty quickly to get theirs. I guess people loved them since all of them were gone by the end of the panel!</p>

<h2> Asami Shimoda and Akiko Hasegawa</h2>

<p>During the weekend, there were three panels featuring Asami Shimoda and Akiko Hasegawa, both of which who are voice actresses for &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idolmaster">THE iDOLM@STER </a>&#8220;. Asami is known for being the voice provider of Kagamine Rin and Len as well. They had very limited autograph and photo sessions during the weekend, so due to the amount of demand for these, limited tickets were given early in the morning. If you didn&#8217;t have a ticket, you had to wait in line after the ticket holders to get yours. Even so, you may or may not have gotten in anyways, only if there was time afterwards. This meant that not many were fortunate to get theirs and there were long hours of waiting for a chance to get a signature or photo if you had no tickets. People lined up for tickets as early as 2 to 3 AM even though it was only opening at 10 AM!</p>
<p>That being said, this was to be expected for such famous guests. It seemed that Friday had the least amount of people waiting, so thankfully, I was able to get a signature from Asami Shimoda and a photo taken with both of the actresses. Due to restrictions on social media, I am prohibited to post the photo session with them on this article, but I can show you guys the autographs. Keep in mind that Asami had attended Anime North the previous year but not Akiko, therefore the demand for her was higher.</p>

<p>Asami seemed very happy when I showed up with the Rin plushy for the photo shoot, as well as when I got her autograph on Rin&#8217;s head that very same day. She spoke a few sentences in Japanese using Rin&#8217;s voice while holding the plushy and said &#8220;thank you&#8221;. It was great hearing the voice actress voicing her own character in person. She even felt a little bad for signing on the back of Rin&#8217;s head. When I went back to get my Len signed on Sunday due to me forgetting to bring it the first time, she did remember me bringing Rin and this time did the same in Len&#8217;s voice. You could tell she was very proud of Rin and Len.</p>
<h2>Q&amp;A Panel</h2>
<p>I attended all three of their panels on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Due to their popularity within &#8220;The iDOLM@STER&#8221;, the majority of the questions were concerning that series, but being a VOCALOID website, I am here to speak about Asami Shimoda mostly. Of course, Akiko had some great questions from fans, and some great and funny answers as well. However, we will stick to the VOCALOID side of things. I got the chance to ask Asami a few questions myself about Rin and Len. Let&#8217;s move on to the questions, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>Question #1:</strong> How was your experience doing the voice recording for Rin and Len, mostly Len due to being male?</p>
<p><strong>Asami:</strong> &#8220;Being a voice actor doing different voices makes it easier to be capable of doing different voices. There isn&#8217;t much difference between the two — Rin is more similar to my normal voice while Len is my voice in lower tone. Anyone can do it if you just practice and try. You should try it!&#8221;</p>
<p>(She said I should try giving it a shot myself in which case I attempted to do Rin&#8217;s voice, but of course I didn&#8217;t do a very good job as anyone at the panel would also agree. It made for a good laugh, however.)</p>
<p><strong>Question #2:</strong> When you were asked to voice Rin and Len, did you expect them to be this popular later on?</p>
<p><strong>Asami: </strong>&#8220;I was surprised when I came to Canada and seen all the cosplays of Rin and Len. Whenever I see them, I just want to go and take a picture with them! I seen two cosplayer&#8217;s outside the panel yesterday (Friday) and was hoping they would be at the panel. They were not.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Question #3:</strong> How was your experience recording Rin and Len?</p>
<p><strong>Asami: </strong>&#8220;The first time recording the two was 9 years ago; each of them took about 5 hours to record. V4X took over 30 hours to do the recording of each. I had to pronounce the English very well for recording. I had an English teacher beside me making sure I pronounced it well. Some words I had to sing in a melodic way over and over in different tones.&#8221; (She used &#8220;airport&#8221; for an example and said it in several different tones.) &#8220;Sometimes, I would do this for hours over and over to get it right, since I had to have a really good pronunciation for recording and that was very hard.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Cosplay</h2>
<p>Conventions are full of all kinds of great cosplays, but once again, I was here for the VOCALOID ones and those are what we will focus on here. When I wasn&#8217;t waiting in line for Asami and Akiko for a signature, photo, or panel for several hours, I was going around the convention looking for some VOCALOID cosplays. There were also three photo shoots during the weekend for only VOCALOIDs, but I missed the one on Friday due to being at the Q&amp;A and such. I did, however, get to be at the ones on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>I took many photos, but I wont post every single one of them here since some are fairly similar. That being said, I believe I have at least one of each cosplay I found. Also, being in such a big place meant that I most likely missed some good ones. I apologize if I missed any of you, but I tried my best! For those of you who are wondering, I did make sure that all of these cosplayers knew that I was going to post these on this website. And now, here are the cosplayers I found during my weekend below.</p>

<h2>Other Things of Interest</h2>
<p>During the event, many other things where happening aside from what I have mentioned above — panels related to anime, the culture, and much more. The dealer room and artist alley had plenty of merchandise and wonderful art to choose from by many great artists. Outside there was food, ping pong, and a stage playing music for a good portion of the night. One song in particular I found to be funny was a hard-style remix of the famous &#8220;Just do it!!&#8221; video. I also attended a maid performance where the performers danced to several songs. These included the Sailor Moon theme, &#8220;Happy Synthesizer&#8221;, and a song from THE iDOLM@STER.</p>

<p>Basically, there&#8217;s something for everyone here!</p>
<p>Lastly, I would like to thank Anime North for giving me this opportunity, the fans I met during the con, all the new people I met, the cosplayers, those of you who showed interest in our panel, and everyone else who made this a great experience for the weekend. I hope to see you all again here next year! Until then, we will be attending other conventions throughout the year. Hopefully, I or the other staff members of VNN will see you there. Stay tuned for our future con announcements!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Quadimension uploaded Stardust&#8217;s first demo song recently as well as announced the opening of preorders for her voice bank, first album, and her art book. They also revealed her voice provider to be the famous Bilibili singer 茶理理 (Chalili).</p>
<h3><strong>Demo<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>The released demo song, &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/115248" target="_blank">StarLaLaLa</a>&#8220;, was produced by <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/14986" target="_blank">ZOMiG</a>. The song itself does not contain any lyrics except &#8220;La&#8221;.  It may be that ZOMiG is paying tribute to his previous song, &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/51590" target="_blank">Lalala.Refrain</a>&#8220;, featured in Quadimension&#8217;s <a href="http://vocadb.net/Al/8040" target="_blank">first album</a>. &#8220;StarLaLaLa&#8221; does not have any tuning in order to showcase her voice and capability. However, Quadimension has promised that Stardust will have more demos in the future.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HgfUiF2_U44?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Her voice bank, album, and art book are also available for purchase at the moment. For more information on those, please see <a href="http://rayduxz.cl/vocaloid/en/stardust-demo-voice-bank-album-and-art-book-preorder-date-confirmed/" target="_blank">our previous article</a>.</p>
<p>The VOCALOID 4 Editor is also available at <a href="https://quadimension.world.taobao.com/" target="_blank">Quadimension&#8217;s Taobao store</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://quadimension.world.taobao.com/" rel="attachment wp-att-4966"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-4968 size-full" src="https://rayduxz.cl/vocaloid/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/02/QQ截图20160220144521-1.png" alt="" width="866" height="553" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QQ截图20160220144521-1.png 866w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QQ截图20160220144521-1-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 866px) 100vw, 866px" /></a></p>
<h3>茶理理 Chalili</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-4969 alignleft" src="https://rayduxz.cl/vocaloid/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/02/Cborx4DWEAAwcQ_.jpg" alt="chalili" width="359" height="444" /><br />
Quadimension had also revealed Stardust&#8217;s voice provider to be 茶理理 (Chalili).</p>
<p>Chalili is a famous online singer and is active on various sites including 5sing, Bilibili, NicoNico, and even YouTube. She is well-known for her sweet, refreshing voice and also her wide vocal range. Chalili is also capable of speaking in both Japanese and English, so Stardust can easily become a bilingual voice bank if Quadimension attempts to do so.</p>
<p>You can find Chalili&#8217;s singing by following these links:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/2434" target="_blank">EmpathP</a> and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/9940" target="_blank">Kenji-B</a> held a live stream to talk about the production of <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/36169" target="_blank">Dex</a> and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/36170" target="_blank">Daina</a> as well as their future plans for a concert and a rhythm game featuring VOCALOIDs. This stream gave new information as well as recapped old information from the previous streams the two have held in the past. If you&#8217;d like to watch the stream, feel free to do so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqq2cmv9xow" target="_blank">here</a>. Otherwise, here&#8217;s a quick recap of what we thought fans would find interesting:</p>
<h3>Question and Answer Tidbits</h3>
<p>Most of the live stream was centered around answering questions that fans brought up and elaborating on other things that were related to the questions asked. Instead of writing out each question, we&#8217;ll be sectioning off the answers into a few different categories and summarizing them.</p>
<h5>The Beginning of Production</h5>
<p>EmpathP (also known as Aki) was originally contacted by the programmer who wishes to remain anonymous (Mr. Programmer) whom she had been friends with for a while. He asked for voice samples from Aki who originally thought they were for a music project he was working on. When he revealed he was going to present her as his choice for a new female VOCALOID for <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/201" target="_blank">Zero-G</a>, she was excited but stunned.</p>
<p>Zero-G chose her for a female voice but wanted a male voice to go along with it. While there were other candidates as possibilities, Mr. Programmer asked Aki to give suggestions on who she thought would work. She noted that Kenji-B and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/919" target="_blank">CircusP</a> were both great singers.</p>
<p>Aki sent Mr. Programmer her and Kenji singing &#8220;Anonymous&#8221; as a sample, and Zero-G loved that she and Kenji had already sung together. After going through the other applicants, they decided on Kenji as the male vocal.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rj_x7q8mLt0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>From there, the two sent in recordings of their voices so that Zero-G could make sure that their voices weren&#8217;t distorted by the VOCALOID engine. Once cleared, the production of Dex and Daina began in January 2015.</p>

<h5>Concepts</h5>
<p>From very early on, Aki and Kenji knew that they wanted to have a &#8220;Fox and the Hound&#8221; theme. They worked on rough designs for the two characters based on what they wanted to see and then let <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/15249" target="_blank">SteelEmissary</a> work on things from there.</p>
<p>During the first concept art of Dex, Aki and Kenji noticed that Dex was coming out looking quite a bit like <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/277" target="_blank">Big AL</a> and asked Steel to add their flare and remove certain features to help make Dex look more unique.</p>
<p>The final designs have a lot of thought put into them that fans may not notice at first glance. These designs have small similarities to the animals Dex and Daina represent. One example that shows this is Daina&#8217;s tall boots and her gloves which are meant to mimic the markings on a fox.</p>
<p>And, as we mentioned in previous articles, Aki and Kenji confirmed again that they were aware of the design change and were okay with it. While disappointed, they understood the reasoning behind it and noted that even the fandom wasn&#8217;t 100% for the kemonomimi designs. However, they still consider the designs with ears and tails to be canon, and Zero-G is completely okay with that.</p>
<h5>Recording</h5>
<figure id="attachment_4930" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4930" style="width: 229px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-4930" src="https://rayduxz.cl/vocaloid/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/02/DexBeta.jpg" alt="First concept sketch of Dex" width="229" height="341" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DexBeta.jpg 418w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DexBeta-202x300.jpg 202w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4930" class="wp-caption-text">First concept sketch of Dex</figcaption></figure>
<p>Kenji and Aki began recording in January 2015. While Kenji finished in April, Aki took until May due to her going to various conventions. They both recorded in their homes in soundproofed rooms and had to schedule their recordings around everything going on in their homes. They did not record while it was noisy and made sure that all of their recordings were of very high quality.</p>
<p>The two re-recorded many times to get their recordings perfect. They didn&#8217;t want to do any pitch correcting and wanted the voice samples to stay 100% natural. For Kenji, recording the stationaries took two hours. According to him, &#8220;there weren&#8217;t even that many of them.&#8221; These two put hours upon hours of work into making sure that these VOCALOIDs were perfect.</p>
<p>If they could change one thing, they would like to change the growls. They compared the growl recordings to Wookie impressions and even made Wookie noises to show exactly how they did the growl. According to them, this is what they were told to do in order to create the growl. They wish they would have gone with the stock growl but at the same time are happy to say Dex and Daina are 100% voiced by them.</p>
<h5>Recommendations</h5>
<p>When asked which voice they would suggest if someone could only buy Dex or Daina, Kenji and Aki were divided. Aki suggested Dex while Kenji said you should get Daina. However, both agreed that Dex and Daina work best together and that buying both of them is a great investment if you want to make songs with either of the VOCALOIDs as it&#8217;s hard to imagine one without the other.</p>
<h5>Using Other VOCALOIDs</h5>
<p>Just because Kenji and Aki are Dex and Daina doesn&#8217;t mean that they plan to only use said VOCALOIDs. They both own many voice banks and use the VOCALOID that works best for whatever song they&#8217;re creating.</p>
<h3>VOCAMERICA</h3>
<figure id="attachment_4936" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4936" style="width: 229px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-4936" src="https://rayduxz.cl/vocaloid/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/02/DexMMD.jpg" alt="Dex Model Teaser" width="229" height="353" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DexMMD.jpg 291w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DexMMD-194x300.jpg 194w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4936" class="wp-caption-text">Dex Model Teaser</figcaption></figure>
<p>EmpathP has been talking about VOCAMERICA here and there for some time now, and we&#8217;ve finally gotten some nice teasers as to what she plans to do.</p>
<p>VOCAMERICA is going to be a concert with original MMD models and animations. Every model will be made from scratch by an unnamed model maker/animator. Aki mentioned that she commissioned a total of five models for the event. At the moment, Dex&#8217;s model is being worked on and there will be a Daina one as well. These two have been confirmed to be the headlining act for VOCAMERICA, but the three other models that are being made are currently unknown.</p>
<p>Aki is currently paying for everything out of pocket and plans to launch a Kickstarter to help make merchandise and the like for the concert. Eventually, she hopes to be able to take the concert on tour. At the moment, there&#8217;s no word on where the first concert will be held, but we can assume it will likely be in North America.</p>
<h3>Kenji-B&#8217;s Rhythm Game</h3>
<p>Kenji is currently planning on creating a rhythm game. The game will definitely feature Dex and Daina but he&#8217;s unsure of what other VOCALOIDs he will be allowed to feature due to licensing. He&#8217;s unsure if there will be a Kickstarter for this project or not, but he will be sure to keep fans informed.</p>
<p>He plans to release a survey later on that will be asking fans what they would want from a commercial rhythm game.</p>
