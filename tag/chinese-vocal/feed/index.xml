										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been so many news about <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/1">Hatsune Miku</a> in the past hours, but now it&#8217;s time to change subjects for a moment: <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/48697">Quadimension</a> just published a new, marvelous demo song for <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/74324">HaiYi</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://vocadb.net/T/6745/synthesizer-v">Synthesizer V</a>&#8216;s voicebank. Let&#8217;s check it out together!</p>
<h3>The Ocean Vocalist Sings Once More!</h3>
<p>Not much time has passed ever since Quadimension dropped HaiYi&#8217;s first demo song on Bilibili using her new voice library, but we eagerly waited for some more demonstrations of her capabilities. As of today, we got the chance to satisfy our demo song needs!</p>
<figure id="attachment_241870" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-241870" style="width: 1723px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-241870 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chrome_2019-08-30_16-50-49.png" alt="" width="1723" height="969" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chrome_2019-08-30_16-50-49.png 1723w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chrome_2019-08-30_16-50-49-300x169.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chrome_2019-08-30_16-50-49-1024x576.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chrome_2019-08-30_16-50-49-800x450.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1723px) 100vw, 1723px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-241870" class="wp-caption-text">Click on the picture to open the video on Bilibili. If it doesn&#8217;t work, click <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/av65964489/">here</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Once again, the demo song they proposed to us is a cover of an already well known song performed by HaiYi: &#8220;<a href="https://vocadb.net/S/251496">STOP</a>&#8220;, composed by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/65709">Cí Dài Jūn</a> with lyrics by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/11693">Nóngsuō Páigǔ</a> accompanied with an amazing vocal tuning provided by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/15357">Napstina</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to this new demo, we can clearly see even more improvements on HaiYi&#8217;s voice, which is even more empathized by Napstina&#8217;s marvelous tuning!</p>
<h3>Source</h3>
<p>HaiYi will clearly have a bright future as a Synthesizer V voice library, and we cannot wait to see more works featuring her! Don&#8217;t forget she&#8217;s already up for pre-order and is going to be released on <strong>September 13th</strong>!</p>
<p>If you missed her pre-order opening article, no need to worry: click <a href="/quadimensions-haiyi-demo-song-and-synthesizer-v-pre-sales-available/">here</a> to find out more!</p>

<h3>The Ocean Singer Enters the Stage</h3>
<p>After so much waiting time, HaiYi finally enters the stage with her first demo song on Synthesizer V! We can hear her graceful yet powerful voice on an original song composed by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/6041">Zeno</a> back when she was using her prototype: &#8220;<a href="https://vocadb.net/S/250929">Shallows</a>&#8220;!</p>

<p>We eagerly waited for her to join the crew on this engine, and the results are absolutely gorgeous! Her voice shows off  lot of potential, and we cannot wait to hear more of her!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seems <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/48697">Quadimension</a> has a thing for publishing new demo songs around the weekend! We just got a new, marvelous demo song for <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/73875">CangQiong</a> titled &#8220;<a href="https://vocadb.net/S/244498">Suspended Spero</a>&#8220;!</p>
<h3>A time for change</h3>
<p>Composed by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/65709">Cí Dài Jūn</a> with lyrics from <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/11693">Nóngsuō Páigǔ</a> and tuning by  <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/49851">Creuzer</a>, this song shows us a new awesome side of this vocalist!</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="【SynthV 五维介质・苍穹】希望悬空【官方演示视频】" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YmufhxMprY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>It&#8217;s surely a rock-esque song that will make you turn up the volume! The tuning is a bit wobbly in places, however, it makes her feel alive! The progression of chorus and verse and everything is pretty clean and overall it is a very good song for CangQiong.</p>
<h3>About buying CangQiong</h3>
<p>She is available on <a href="https://world.taobao.com/">Taobao</a>!</p>
<p>She&#8217;s priced<strong> 500 RMB</strong> for her digital version, adding <strong>15 RMB</strong> you can also get the code shipped to you, and if you don&#8217;t own a Synthesizer V license yet, you get them both together for <strong>595 RMB</strong>!</p>
<p><em>Those prices however won&#8217;t last forever: once the sale period ends she will be back at her standard price so hurry up!</em></p>
<p>Her release date is scheduled for July 12th and you can buy her <a href="https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=597812195230">here</a>!</p>

<h3>A Cutesy Voice Approaches!</h3>
<p>We have been waiting for ShiAn&#8217;s full demo song for quite a while now and today we finally get the chance to hear her sing for us! Let&#8217;s check it out together!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/av54070954"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-225486" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chrome_2019-05-31_12-36-26.png" alt="" width="1920" height="969" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chrome_2019-05-31_12-36-26.png 1920w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chrome_2019-05-31_12-36-26-300x151.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chrome_2019-05-31_12-36-26-1024x517.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chrome_2019-05-31_12-36-26-800x404.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a></p>
<p><em>Click the picture to open the video on Bilibili! </em>This amazing song, titled &#8220;<a href="https://vocadb.net/S/239554">禁忌Apple Dance</a>&#8221; (&#8220;Jìnjì Apple Dance&#8221;), was entirely made and tuned by Zeno, it also shows <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/57808">Hanasa</a> and <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/57809">ATDan</a>&#8216;s illustration of this little cute vocalist from our favorite virtual singer group! We couldn&#8217;t help but be amazed by how her cutesy voice resonates with such a rhythmic tune, good job Zeno!</p>
<h3>Not Even Her Final Form?!</h3>
<p>However, as the heading said, this demo doesn&#8217;t show her true potential.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-225498" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chrome_2019-06-01_00-37-17.png" alt="" width="1103" height="164" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chrome_2019-06-01_00-37-17.png 1103w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chrome_2019-06-01_00-37-17-300x45.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chrome_2019-06-01_00-37-17-1024x152.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chrome_2019-06-01_00-37-17-800x119.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1103px) 100vw, 1103px" /></p>
<p>As Ddickky says on a comment, this demo song is using a prototype of her voice bank, therefore, her final product will be slightly different from the one we have listened to.</p>
<p>ShiAn&#8217;s development is taking longer than they expected and the process didn&#8217;t meet their scheduled plan, but we will get an update on her status and voice quality soon!</p>
<h3>Pre-orders</h3>
<p>Last but not least, they have also opened pre-orders for ShiAn&#8217;s Synthesizer V voice library!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-225510 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/O1CN01mNXQbe1OTODbM0W9Z_678151706-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="618" height="618" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/O1CN01mNXQbe1OTODbM0W9Z_678151706-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/O1CN01mNXQbe1OTODbM0W9Z_678151706-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/O1CN01mNXQbe1OTODbM0W9Z_678151706-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/O1CN01mNXQbe1OTODbM0W9Z_678151706-800x800.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/O1CN01mNXQbe1OTODbM0W9Z_678151706-100x100.jpg 100w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/O1CN01mNXQbe1OTODbM0W9Z_678151706.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></p>
<p>ShiAn&#8217;s voicebank will be available in both physical and digital versions.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shian.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-225535 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shian.png" alt="" width="915" height="538" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shian.png 915w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shian-300x176.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shian-800x470.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px" /></a></p>

<p>ChiYu isn&#8217;t the only thing we got revealed today! Do you recognized this song? It&#8217;s the same one used for <a href="/vocal-sample-of-quadimensions-synthesizer-v-chiyu-published/">her previous vocal sample</a>. We now finally know its lyrics, title and author. It is titled &#8220;<a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/72386">翡夜Racing Game</a>&#8221; (&#8220;Fěi yè Racing Game&#8221;) and was composed by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/6041">Zeno</a> for our new fire maiden&#8217;s introduction. Her voice is filled with power, bringing us a sharp and memorable voice to Synthesizer V&#8217;s Virtual Singers&#8217; cast.</p>
<p>Her design and illustration were revealed today as well and they were made by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/57808">Hanasa</a>, <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/57809">ATDan</a> and <strong>Kurumimi</strong>. ChiYu&#8217;s outfit is exactly what we would expect for such a powerful vocalist, inspired by fire, and we cannot wait for her to make even more appearances in the future!</p>
<h3>Pre-Orders</h3>
<p>ChiYu&#8217;s voicebank, as we previously confirmed not long ago, is running in the Synthesizer V engine made by <strong>Dreamtonics</strong>, and she is up for pre-order now! her voice library is available in both digital and physical version through Quadimension&#8217;s Taobao store and comes in bundle with SynthV&#8217;s editor.</p>

<p>Her release date is scheduled to be on April 30th for the digital version, which is priced 500 RMB and includes:</p>

<li>ChiYu&#8217;s voice library installer and serial number;</li>
<li>User manual and installation guide;</li>
<li>Physical shipping of the code to your home (in Mainland China&#8217;s territory, and will require an extra fee).</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we discovered that <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/72386"><em>ChiYu</em></a>, the latest addition to the <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/48697">Quadimension</a>&#8216;s MEDIUM⁵ cast, is confirmed to be running on the Synthesizer V engine. Now, only few hours apart from her vocal sample becoming public, we got another demo song!</p>
<h3>New Short Demo Song</h3>
<p>While her previous vocal sample was only meant to give us a glimpse of her voice type, this new short demo song published by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/34370">KIDE</a> shows ChiYu&#8217;s vocal at its finest. You can listen to it via Bilibili below!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/av49054605" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-216872 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chrome_2019-04-12_11-54-18.png" alt="" width="1086" height="699" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chrome_2019-04-12_11-54-18.png 1086w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chrome_2019-04-12_11-54-18-300x193.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chrome_2019-04-12_11-54-18-1024x659.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chrome_2019-04-12_11-54-18-800x515.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1086px) 100vw, 1086px" /></a></p>

<p>ChiYu certainly does have a more sharp tone compared to her fellow MEDIUM⁵ members. This gives her a more peculiar role on the group and definitely fits her fire element quite a lot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is time to talk about <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/48697">Quadimension</a>&#8216;s latest addition to their MEDIUM⁵ character group. The fifth member that we teased not long ago, based off of the fire element: ChiYu!</p>
<h3>A New Character&#8230; Running on Synthesizer V?!</h3>
<p>Seems we can finally confirm a solid collaboration between Dreamtonics and Quadimension, as ChiYu is now confirmed to be a new vocal running on Synthesizer V&#8217;s engine.  This got revealed just few hours ago by the team, via their own official Weibo, with a video showing us a sample of her voice! You can watch it below!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.weibo.com/5599743152/Hp9dAtP34"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-216768 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chrome_2019-04-11_14-59-38.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chrome_2019-04-11_14-59-38.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chrome_2019-04-11_14-59-38-300x169.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chrome_2019-04-11_14-59-38-800x450.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><em>By clicking the image you will be redirected to <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/35966">Stardust</a>&#8216;s official Weibo post. You can also <a href="https://www.weibo.com/5599743152/Hp9dAtP34">click here</a>, in case you don&#8217;t see the screenshot!</em></p>
<p>Sure, this sample is short and only shows her singing in &#8220;Na Na Na&#8221; samples, but considering Stardust&#8217;s vocal sample, <a href="https://vocadb.net/S/115248">StarLaLaLa</a> by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/14986">ZOMiG</a> wasn&#8217;t much different, we could say ChiYu is following her sister&#8217;s footsteps awesomely by providing us such a simple yet catchy demo song!</p>
<p>ChiYu also got a <a href="https://www.weibo.com/u/6612855476">Weibo account</a>, meaning we can all follow her more closely while we wait for more details about her!</p>
<h3>Sources</h3>
<p>We cannot wait to hear more of ChiYu&#8217;s marvelous vocal, as well as her own character design! Since she is based off of fire, what kind of appearance will she have, we wonder&#8230; Only time will tell!</p>
