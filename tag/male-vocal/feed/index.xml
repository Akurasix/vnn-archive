										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Onseogosei no Seiyujimusha, translated as &#8220;Voice Synth Voice Actors&#8217; Office&#8221; is far from new, they have a rather new addition that&#8217;s bringing the series of voice banks to new levels! In addition to their many talking voice banks, they now have a singing voice bank unlike any other.</p>
<h3>About Onseogosei no Seiyujimusha</h3>
<p>As mentioned, Onseogosei no Seiyujimusha translates to &#8220;Voice Synth Voice Actors&#8217; Office.&#8221; It&#8217;s a series of voice banks with a little bit of plot surrounding them. These banks are all members of an office and work to serve those who hire them.</p>
<p>Their introduction even sounds like an office secretary wrote it!</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8216;Onseogosei no Seiyujimusha&#8217; is a voice synth project that started in 2017 and is celebrating its first anniversary come this spring. Our voice synth software, which is capable of expressing emotions, will work hard to fit your needs!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>About the Software</h3>

<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cover_logo-1.png'><img width="300" height="137" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cover_logo-1-300x137.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cover_logo-1-300x137.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cover_logo-1.png 522w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>

<p>Onseogosei no Seiyujimusha utilizes the VoiceText engine by HOYA CORPORATION. Unfortunately, at this time, it&#8217;s only available commercially. However, there&#8217;s always a chance that this will change in the future!</p>
<p>The software&#8217;s official page advertises four special features of voice text: Emotion, Making Original Voices, Changing How the Voices Talk, and the Singing Synthesizer. The following points are translated from the website. Please note that the translations have been changed slightly to make more sense in English.</p>
<h5>Point 1: Emotion</h5>
<p>With VoiceText, happy, sad, and angry emotions are available. Through expression settings, you can control the strength and weakness of the voice. Through the emotions settings, you can control the strength of emotions. This allows you to have the phrase sound however you&#8217;d like it to. This makes for fun conversations featuring voices that don&#8217;t sound like robots but like humans.</p>
<h5>Point 2: Making Original Voices</h5>
<p>You can create your own original voice synth by recording your own voice or the voice of a voice actor. You can even revive the voice of people who have passed away. In addition to creating the voice itself and giving it emotions, you can attach special sentence-enders to all the sentences (like a cat ending every sentence with &#8220;Nyan!&#8221;). You can find an in-depth tutorial (in Japanese) <a href="http://voicetext.jp/products/vt-original/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h5>Point 3: Changing How They Talk</h5>
<p>You can combine a character&#8217;s voice with another character&#8217;s speaking style. You can combine characters with different accents to create new ways of speaking or combining two voices to make them cuter. Perfect for people who want a different voice from those provided.</p>
<h5>Singing Synthesizer</h5>
<p>You input the melody and lyrics, and create a song. Unlike other vocal synths, it doesn&#8217;t go by one sound at a time but instead uses a statistical model to create smooth and clear singing. It has the warmth of a human being singing.</p>
<p>They are using a new style of singing voice synthesis technology developed mainly by Professor Keiichi Tokuda of Nagoya Institute of Technology, and speech analysis and synthesis system <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/transinf/E99.D/7/E99.D_2015EDP7457/_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WORLD</a> developed by Professor Masanori Morise of Yamanashi University.</p>
<h3>The Characters</h3>
<p>At the moment, there are 11 characters capable of speaking — one of whom is debuting as an idol. Unless otherwise stated, the voice is capable of happy, sad, and angry emotions.</p>
<h4>The Newcomer Idol</h4>

<p>Fans have been waiting a long time for the release of <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/39621">Yuezheng Longya</a>, and as time continues, more information is revealed. However, we still have no release date, but what we do have are the names of his voice banks!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Longya will be getting two voice banks, the first being &#8220;淳&#8221; (Chun) which means &#8220;pure but with thickness&#8221; (essentially, the normal voice of a man).</p>
<p>His second voice bank is &#8220;雅&#8221; (Ya) which means &#8220;elegant, gentle, and soft&#8221; (Soft voice bank).</p>
<p>His Normal and Soft voice banks will be released together. A &#8220;Power&#8221; voice bank had been planned for him, but Vsinger&#8217;s voice bank producer, <a href="http://m.weibo.cn/status/4074307468838591">RenXingTu</a>, announced that they have decided to push back the production to prioritize <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/56345">Mo Qingxian</a> and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/56346">Zhiyu Moke</a>&#8216;s voice banks.</p>
</div>
<p>Vsinger has also announced his first official demo &#8220;In Your breath&#8221; will be available February 14th on <a href="http://music.163.com/#">NetEase Music</a>. Note that NetEase Music is currently not available outside of China, however, don&#8217;t worry since Vsinger usually uploads their music on Bilibili and even sometimes YouTube later!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/39621">Yuezheng Longya</a>&#8216;s First Demo</h4>
<figure id="attachment_71616" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71616" style="width: 533px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-71616" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/15456.jpg" alt="15456" width="533" height="299" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/15456.jpg 597w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/12/15456-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-71616" class="wp-caption-text">直播前一天官博便拐着弯告知粉丝，龙牙将首次展现他的声音。</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yesterday, Luo Tianyi&#8217;s Weibo announced an upcoming live stream event on Taobao for December 4th. Meanwhile, Longya was hinting his first demo will be featured in the stream. Nonetheless, it was the well-known &#8220;Mo Li Hua.&#8221;</p>
<p>The invited guests on the show were 人形兔, 阿良良木健, 小白 (Vsinger&#8217;s official artist), and the voice provider of Longya, &#8220;AJie&#8221;. 人形兔 happily announced that the first male Chinese voice bank was finally completed when the audience asked about Longya.</p>
<p>Before playing the demo, the host allowed AJie to sing a short verse of &#8220;Mo Li Hua&#8221; as a comparison.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F296141739&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=618&#038;maxheight=927"></iframe></p>
<p>As a professional voice actor, AJia admitted that recording a VOCALOID voice bank was nothing like what he usually does for voicing a movie or TV drama; it was a whole new area for him.</p>
<p>After the stream, Vsinger announced that there will be more demo songs showcasing the voice bank&#8217;s potential. A press conference will be held on December 8th, so hopefully, there will be more information on Longya.</p>
<h4>Luo Tianyi Merchandise Open for Pre-order!</h4>
<p>Aside from Longya, the stream was also holding a giveaway of the latest Luo Tianyi merchandise series, including: a Luo Tianyi pen, Luo Tianyi mug, Luo Tianyi &#8220;Heart Connection&#8221; USB cable, and a Luo Tianyi flash drive. If you are interested in purchasing all of the mentioned merchandise, you might consider purchasing the Limited Vsinger Gift Pack for the price of ￥228 CNY ($33 USD). The gift pack is limited to 100 units.</p>
<p>Fans can pre-order the merchandise on Shanghai HeNian&#8217;s official Taobao. <a href="https://shop69979973.world.taobao.com/dc-3773.htm?spm=a21tz.8256630.3184494988.2.ofjHwl">Click here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On this day last year, the much anticipated American English VOCALOIDs DEX &amp; DAINA were finally released after a bit of waiting on the go-ahead from YAMAHA. Fans were delighted to see these VOCALOIDs come into the spotlight, but never would we have imagined that these two would go so far in such little time. So today, we&#8217;re celebrating the first birthday of DEX &amp; DAINA by looking back at the past year and how much these two VOCALOIDs have grown.</p>
<h3>Release</h3>
<p>EmpathP and Kenji-B promoted DEX &amp; DAINA as much as they could and, as a result, the two were very anxiously awaited. Fans would tune in to live streams for all of the DEX and DAINA updates and, after much anticipation, the two were released with much celebration.</p>
<p>EmpathP and Kenji-B made several demos featuring the two, some of which were released while one stayed hidden until recently when the <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/Al/19907" target="_blank">VOCAMERICA Official Soundtrack</a></em> was released.</p>
<p>Fans grabbed up DEX &amp; DAINA, and the two did very well for English VOCALOIDs. But their release was only the beginning of their rise.</p>
<h3>Popular Songs</h3>
<p>DEX &amp; DAINA have seen their fair share of popular songs. While none have hit an incredibly high mark, many have seen relatively high success when compared to other English VOCALOID songs.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rLdMM696naM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CFvr3THzpeg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HV70kQnDur8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tMIjxkY5DTY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RG2Gp2RWJBg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h5>&#8220;Secret Garden&#8221;</h5>
<p>In addition to popular songs outside of those made by EmpathP and Kenji-B, there&#8217;s also one song that blew up not only in the VOCALOID fandom but also crossed into the <em>Undertale</em> fandom as well. &#8220;Secret Garden&#8221; marked the first song in a series of <em>Undertale</em> inspired VOCALOID originals, and it grew incredibly popular very fast.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wH3bMZXA4W8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to using DEX as the voice of Sans, it also uses CYBER DIVA and DAINA for the female vocals.</p>
<p>This is likely one of the most viewed English VOCALOID songs in existence.</p>
<h3>VOCAMERICA</h3>
<p>And, of course, you can&#8217;t mention DEX &amp; DAINA without VOCAMERICA! The Western VOCALOID Concert project is one of EmpathP&#8217;s biggest projects and features the two birthday VOCALOIDs as the headlining acts. The two received merchandise and, of course, got to perform on stage for fans! The first concert went incredibly well and people are excited for the next one.</p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>Within the first year of their release, DEX &amp; DAINA have accomplished more than a lot of VOCALOIDs ever do. The two aren&#8217;t as successful as many other VOCALOIDs but, at the same time, they&#8217;ve seen a huge deal of success when compared to most Western VOCALOIDs. And their success is bringing success to other Western VOCALOIDs as well. As the two continue on their VOCAMERICA path and people continue to use them, they&#8217;re sure to keep doing well.</p>
<p>Hopefully by this time next year, DEX &amp; DAINA will be even more popular. So let&#8217;s continue to support them for years to come!</p>
<h3>Fan Submissions</h3>
<p>Last week, we invited fans to submit original works to celebrate this special occasion! We received quite a few entries and all of them were absolutely amazing. Thank you everyone for participating! You can find all of the submissions below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The official <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yamaha.vocaloid" target="_blank">VOCALOID Facebook page</a> as well as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CCrusherP/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Crusher-P</a> have just announced a new V4 VOCALOID: &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/53367" target="_blank">CYBER SONGMAN</a>&#8220;. As one may be able to guess, he&#8217;s in the same series as the female V4 vocal, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/31020" target="_blank">CYBER DIVA</a>.</p>
<h3>Voice Bank Information</h3>
<p>Recommended Range: A1 to A3<br />
Recommended Tempo: 70 to 190 BPM</p>
<h5>Extra Features</h5>
<p>CYBER SONGMAN has a second User Dictionary. One can switch between the two in order to have a more British or American accent.</p>
<p>In addition, he has two extra phonemes: [4] and [@l].</p>
[4] is the American English tap-t sound. It&#8217;s used in words like &#8220;better&#8221; where there&#8217;s not quite the sound of a T nor a D.</p>
[@l] is a syllabic [l] sound (that&#8217;s lower-case L). It&#8217;s used in words like &#8220;apple&#8221;.</p>
<p>Below, you can listen to a comparison of CYBER SONGMAN with and without the extra phonemes.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F290354871&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=618&#038;maxheight=927"></iframe><br />
He&#8217;s also capable of “gruff” and “harsh” voice expressions, which can be used for a wider range of sound effects or for particular music genres.</p>
<p>And, of course, he&#8217;s able to Growl as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first Chinese male VOCALOID <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/39621">Yuezheng Longya</a> has been quiet since his <a href="http://vocaloid.news/1stY1qp">V4 design suggestion</a>. To calm his anticipated fans, <a href="http://weibo.com/5582156776/EaWOaA2ff?type=comment#_rnd1475387317529">Vsinger</a> has finally announced that his voice bank is in the final production stage. It will be going through the packaging process and is now awaiting approval from YAMAHA. However, Vsinger has still not revealed his final design. They said that they will make an announcement once the design is confirmed. The featured art on Weibo are NOT his final designs.</p>
<figure id="attachment_62734" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-62734" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-62734 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/图片1.png" alt="longya announcement" width="554" height="433" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/图片1.png 554w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/图片1-300x234.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-62734" class="wp-caption-text">Artist in P1 : 苍狼野兽（http://weibo.com/guanyibl）</figcaption></figure>
<p>Vsinger has also prepared five Yuezheng Longya &#8220;VALUE SOUL&#8221; pendants to give away through a Weibo lottery. Fans are required to follow <a href="http://weibo.com/yuezhenglongya0712">Yuezheng Longya&#8217;s official Weibo</a>, share the <a href="http://weibo.com/5582156776/EaWOaA2ff?type=comment#_rnd1475387317529">original Weibo post</a>, and tag one of your friends to enter.</p>
<p>Vsinger has not revealed much about Longya since the reveal of his voice provider, the famous Chinese voice actor &#8220;张杰&#8221;. We may get to hear his voice by the end of 2016 or early 2017! VNN will make sure to keep you updated on any upcoming Longya news!</p>
