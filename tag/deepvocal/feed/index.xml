<h2>About Maki Watase</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.crusher-p.com/Maki%20Watase%20New%20Design%20ref3.png" alt=""/><figcaption>Concept art by Crusher-P</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/17246">Maki Watase</a>, 渡瀬マキ, debuted initially in 2009 as a CV UTAU! Over the years she&#8217;s gone through numerous phases, from a CV to a VCV! For her 10 year anniversary, she&#8217;s gotten a new look and this new DeepVocal voicebank. Will it be the only one? Who knows! We hope she prospers and brings light to this new engine.</p>



<h2>Voicebank Information</h2>



<p>The voicebank released is a public beta and can be downloaded <a href="https://www.crusher-p.com/maki">here</a>. It&#8217;s a Japanese library able to recognize romaji and hiragana, with ending breaths aliased as &#8220;H&#8221;, and 4 pitches (&#8220;Timbres&#8221; in DeepVocal). Included with the download link is a bug report form to improve the vocal for it&#8217;s full release. The vocal programming for DeepVocal was done by Infoholic. (Me!) Have a listen below!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After over 1000 applicants for the closed beta, <strong><a href="https://vocadb.net/T/7191/deepvocal">DeepVocal</a></strong> creator <strong><a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/52000">Boxstar</a> </strong>has made his software available for open beta, along with a fancy new website that can be <a href="https://www.deep-vocal.com/#/"><strong>found here</strong></a> in English as well as Traditional and Simplified Chinese!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-233860" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chrome_2019-07-15_20-18-59.png" alt="" width="1920" height="969" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chrome_2019-07-15_20-18-59.png 1920w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chrome_2019-07-15_20-18-59-300x151.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chrome_2019-07-15_20-18-59-1024x517.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chrome_2019-07-15_20-18-59-800x404.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Included on the website is the <a href="https://www.deep-vocal.com/#/Product"><strong>download page</strong></a>, <strong><a href="https://www.deep-vocal.com/#/Usage">Terms of Service</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://www.deep-vocal.com/#/Eula">End-User License</a><a href="https://www.deep-vocal.com/#/Eula"> Agreement</a></strong>, as well as the manual for voicebank creation.</p>
<p>A little important info about creating a DeepVocal character, as seen on the ToS page and told by developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not forfeit you character rights if you want to move your UTAU character to DeepVocal!</li>
<li>On the other hand, if you move your DeepVocal to UTAU, it requires new artwork but not a new design.</li>
<li>Do not redistribute or sell DeepVocal, the DeepVocalToolBox or DeepVocal voicebanks without Boxstar&#8217;s permission.</li>
</ul>
