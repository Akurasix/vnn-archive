<p>AHS revealed teaser images and bonuses for buying the product in late 2019. Now that it&#8217;s out, let&#8217;s get a look at what they have in store.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="758" height="626" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/0b3458b43bcd9976276284d7d3d5fc06.png" alt="" class="wp-image-248941" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/0b3458b43bcd9976276284d7d3d5fc06.png 758w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/0b3458b43bcd9976276284d7d3d5fc06-300x248.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px" /></figure>



<p>Purchase of the calendar is here, on its <a href="https://www.ah-soft.net/shopdetail/000000001147/ct116/page1/order/">product page!</a></p>



<p>The AHS calendar is priced at 1,500 JPY; 1,650 JPY after tax (~$15 USD). The calendar features all characters in their updated designs from VOCALOID4 through VOICEROID2! Additionally, the company revealed the illustrations for each month.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="721" height="380" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ca3106eaef17051abe2b6397ee225e1b.png" alt="" class="wp-image-248954" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ca3106eaef17051abe2b6397ee225e1b.png 721w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ca3106eaef17051abe2b6397ee225e1b-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" /></figure>



<p>Following the initial release of the calendar, AHS added that there will be bonus gifts given on a first come, first serve basis.</p>



<p>As of now, customers who purchase the calendar can receive a &#8220;card-sized&#8221; calendar featuring Nekomura Iroha. </p>



<p>Not only that, but they will also get an &#8220;AHS Original&#8221; postcard! This postcard features Haruno Sora, Tsurumaki Maki and Kaai Yuki! </p>

<p>Furthermore, each calendar has two different sides. One side features a full illustration, and the other shows the calendar. This way you can choose between displaying art or following the days. </p>



<p>Be sure to grab your calendar as soon as possible so you don&#8217;t miss out on your bonuses! Which character are you excited to see featured? Let us know in the comments!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Fans of AHS VOCALOIDs, rejoice! In honor of the company&#8217;s 10th anniversary, a contest has been announced by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/323">EHAMIC</a> to celebrate the event!</p>



<p>AH Software Co., Ltd is the company responsible for the VOCALOIDs such as <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/146">sf-a2 miki</a>, <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/191">Kaai Yuki</a> and <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/246">Hiyama Kiyoteru</a>. These character vocals are AHS&#8217; first foray into singing software from back in 2009. </p>



<p>Since then, several more vocals have since been released, such as <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/77">Nekomura Iroha</a>, <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/623">Yuzuki Yukari</a>, <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/16933">Tohoku Zunko</a>, <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/36099">Macne Nana</a>, <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/63339">Kizuna Akari</a> and <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/67092">Haruno Sora</a>. </p>



<p>Deespite a healthy library of VOCALOID and VOICEROID voicebanks alike, AH Soft has been tragically lacking in recognition and appreciation despite their 10 year tenure.</p>



<p>Luckily, one longtime fan and producer is looking to change that.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">現在進行形です。イラストレーター募集中！<br><br>かなり事態が動きまして、おかげさまでとても順調に進んでおります。<br>みなさまご理解ご協力本当に感謝してます！！！<br><br>[TwiPla] AHSボーカロイド祝10周年コンピレーションアルバム企画中 <a href="https://t.co/avGdAv0yW5">https://t.co/avGdAv0yW5</a></p>&mdash; EHAMIC エハミック (@EHAMIC) <a href="https://twitter.com/EHAMIC/status/1162399087062208512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2019</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p><strong>EHAMIC</strong>, writer of over 70 songs and well-respected contributor to the VOCALOID community, has taken it upon himself to put together this contest!</p>



<p>According to the producer, the event is being held to mark the 10th anniversary with some much needed appreciation for AHS. </p>



<p>He laments that there aren&#8217;t very many events going on in 2019, especially in the realm of Yukari and friends&#8217; company. So in order to reconcile this, he&#8217;s decided to put the project together, himself!</p>



<h3>Song Contest Requirements</h3>



<p>In order to enter the song contest, entrants need to make sure they can meet all of the following requirements.</p>



<ul><li>The song <em>must</em> use an AHS VOCALOID. Voicebanks from other companies, even if used as backing vocals or otherwise, will not be permitted.</li><li>Contestants must be available to reach via SNS (Twitter, email, etc.)</li><li>Themes that revolve around celebrations and anniversaries in general, or specifically for AHS&#8217; 10th anniversary.</li><li>Contestants must be current creators of songs (having been on hiatus or retired will not allow entry), regardless of skill! Professionals and hobbyists are all welcome in this competition.</li></ul>



<p>The song contest will end on two dates. The earliest submissions are accepted is <strong>September 10th</strong>. This is available if you need your song to be mixed down by someone else. </p>



<p>With this method, you can send in the .wav file raw, and it will be mixed by a participant in the judging panel. </p>



<p>Otherwise, the deadline is <strong>September 20th</strong> if you send in your song fully mixed. </p>



<h3>Album Cover Art Contest</h3>



<p>The contest for the album art has a good number of similarities to the song conest, but just a few notable differences to keep in mind!</p>



<ul><li>The album art must feature an AHS VOCALOID; there is no limit whether you wish to feature one, all, or a number in between of the characters AHS has provided.</li><li>Artists must also be readily available via SNS (Twitter, email, etc.)</li><li>Themes must revolve around a celebration or anniversaries, most specifically the AHS 10th anniversary</li><li>Contestants for the art contest must also be current artists (no hiatus or retired artists who no longer upload). Professionals, hobbyists and anyone in between are also welcome!</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Art Specifications</strong></h4>



<ul><li>Drawings must be 12 cm x 12 cm in size (standard square CD jacket)</li><li>400 DPI resolution minimum in order to print clearly</li><li>Minor adjustments to the cover, such as the addition of text, will be added later if necessary</li></ul>



<p>The deadline for the art contest is <strong>September 10th,</strong> and there won&#8217;t be an extension! Get to work quickly if you wish to contribute!</p>



<h3>Contest Prizes</h3>



<p>EHAMIC hasn&#8217;t decided how many prizes will be given out to either participants or just to the winners, but he has told us what exactly the prizes will be despite who gets them.</p>



<ul><li>The finished, physical CD</li><li>Other compensation is being considered, but has not been decided yet. </li></ul>



<p>This article will be updated with more information as it comes out! Please be patient while we wait with EHAMIC to decide what all will come of this contest. </p>



<p>He does note that because it is being produced by the fan community and not the company itself, it is not clear how much will go into the financials of putting this album together, let alone the prizes for the contest.</p>



<p>He does suggest that further prizes beyond the CD itself are in the works, however, so stay tuned! There&#8217;s no telling what could come of this love letter to AHS.</p>



<h4>Extra Details</h4>



<p>EHAMIC explains in the extended contest post that he intends to have the CD put together and published by October 20th.</p>



<p>His wish is to have the physical CD brought to AH Software&#8217;s studio, as a gift to thank them for all their hard work! </p>



<p>He wants any fans who can go to Tokyo to bring a copy of the CD to present to AHS staff with him, so that more AHS employees can have this album as a gift.</p>



<p>The presentation to the staff will be roughly around November 17th. However, it&#8217;s possible the date will shift later on. We&#8217;ll keep you posted on future updates!</p>



<p>The CD will be available to purchase and will be given out to winners and participants as well, so don&#8217;t worry!</p>



<p>The contest will be ending nearly a month from now, so if you wish to get your shot in, now&#8217;s the time!</p>



<p>Good luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>December 18th marks VOCALOID <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/13431" target="_blank">MAIKA</a>&#8216;s anniversary! To celebrate her third birthday, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/989" target="_blank">Voctro Labs</a> is holding a special anniversary sale until December 22nd!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MAIKA-1-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-11156" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MAIKA-1-1-1001x1024.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="368" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MAIKA-1-1-1001x1024.jpg 1001w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MAIKA-1-1-293x300.jpg 293w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MAIKA-1-1-1100x1125.jpg 1100w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MAIKA-1-1.jpg 1330w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></a></p>
<h3>The Sale</h3>
<p>Until December 22nd, fans can purchase the boxed version of MAIKA for €99 (about $104 USD) and receive the boxed version of <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/384" target="_blank">Bruno</a> &amp; <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/385" target="_blank">Clara</a> for free! Bruno and Clara&#8217;s boxed version costs €109 (about $114 USD).</p>
<p>This sale applies ONLY to the boxed versions of the softwares. You can&#8217;t purchase MAIKA&#8217;s download version and receive downloads of Bruno &amp; Clara.</p>
<p>In addition, these purchases don&#8217;t come with the VOCALOID Editor. In order to use these VOCALOIDs fully, you&#8217;ll have to purchase either the VOCALOID 3 or VOCALOID 4 Editor separately. They do, however, come with the Tiny VOCALOID Editor to get you started.</p>
<h3>About the VOCALOIDs</h3>
<p>Bruno, Clara, and MAIKA are all Spanish VOCALOIDs made by Voctro Labs. MAIKA, however, has phonemes that make her able to sing in a variety of languages. Official demos show her singing in Catalan, Italian, English, and Japanese. This makes her voice bank incredibly versatile.</p>
<p>Bruno and Clara don&#8217;t have the extra phonemes but still offer incredible voices. And with the deal of getting them both for free, it&#8217;s hard to pass up! The Spanish VOCALOID trio is definitely not one to miss and now&#8217;s a great time for lovers of the boxed versions to grab all three for an insanely low price!</p>
<h3>How to Purchase</h3>
<p>You can purchase MAIKA&#8217;s boxed and digital versions on Voctro&#8217;s website <a href="http://www.voctro-vocaloid.com/en/maika" target="_blank">here</a>. You can also check out Bruno and Clara <a href="http://www.voctro-vocaloid.com/en/brunoclara" target="_blank">here</a>. The product pages also provide demos of their respective VOCALOIDs, so be sure to check them out!</p>
<p>You can also skim the VocaDB pages of the three for even more songs.</p>
<p><a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/13431" target="_blank">MAIKA</a><br />
<a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/384" target="_blank">Bruno</a><br />
<a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/385" target="_blank">Clara</a></p>
<p>Please note that VocaDB is not affiliated with Voctro Labs and is simply a database created by the community. Unless specifically marked as an official demo, the song isn&#8217;t officially recognized by Voctro Labs.</p>
<p>You can also follow MAIKA on Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VocaloidMaikaOficial/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="/fanloid-potential-added-vocaloid-4-software-update/">More Fanloid Potential Added with VOCALOID 4 Software Update</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="/">VNN</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We previously covered AHS&#8217;s announcement that almost all of the V3 and V4 VOCALOIDs would be able to cross synthesize with each other. Now we have more information on this tool as well as another company joining in! As of the VOCALOID 4 Editor / VOCALOID 4 Editor for Cubase Ver.4.3.0 update, AHS and Internet Co. VOCALOIDs will be able to cross synthesize with other VOCALOIDs. This leads to even more potential for fans to create interesting new voices and increases the ways fans can create a fanloid of their own.</p>
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>
<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/XSYPreviously.png'><img width="300" height="243" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/XSYPreviously-300x243.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/XSYPreviously-300x243.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/XSYPreviously.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>
<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/XSYNow.png'><img width="300" height="243" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/XSYNow-300x243.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/XSYNow-300x243.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/XSYNow.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>
</p>
<p>Before this update, only V4 and some V3 VOCALOID voice banks could cross synthesize (XSY) with each other and they were restricted to the voice banks in their library. Yukari&#8217;s V4 voice banks could all XSY with each other, but she couldn&#8217;t cross synth with Tohoku Zunko or Yukari V3, for example. This new update allows different voice banks to XSY with completely different voice banks, creating a wide range of different voices for fans to try.</p>
<h5>Restrictions</h5>
<p>At the moment, only AHS and Internet Co. VOCALOIDs are capable of this function and they can only XSY with other VOCALOIDs from the same company. So, for example, GUMI V4 Natural can&#8217;t cross synthesize with Yukari Onn.</p>
<p>There are also a few voice banks from these companies that aren&#8217;t able to XSY with other voice banks at all. From AHS, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/28164" target="_blank">Kaai Yuki</a> is excluded and Internet Co. has excluded <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/4634" target="_blank">GUMI English</a>.</p>
<h3>Included VOCALOIDs</h3>

<p>Fans who want to use the feature should update to the 4.3.0 version of the VOCALOID 4 Editor.</p>

<p>Of course, you&#8217;ll have to own these VOCALOIDs to use their voice banks.

To top it off, the starter pack also comes with the VOCALOID 4 Editor, letting anyone without it start right away!</p>
<hr />
<p>In addition, AHS gave an example of this new cross synthesis during <a href="https://abemafresh.tv/ahs/43506" target="_blank">their latest live stream</a>. Start around the 1:18:00 mark to get a listen!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll all be looking forward to the new addition to cross synthesis capabilities. AHS is actually encouraging fans to use this to create their own fanloids as well! And with so many voices to choose from, the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>So stay tuned for more information on this as it surfaces! We&#8217;ll be sure to let fans know when AHS releases any updates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While IA has covered songs sung by her voice actress before (the most famous being &#8220;Tori no Uta&#8221;), her acapella cover of &#8220;Kimi Wa Hitori Nankaja Naiyo&#8221; (&#8220;You&#8217;re Not Alone&#8221;) takes things a step further and even gives fans a new way to listen to 1st Place&#8217;s VOCALOID. And as an added bonus, all purchases of the song go to charity!</p>
<h5>Press Release</h5>
<p>IA&#8217;s acapella cover of &#8220;Kimi Wa Hitori Nankaja Naiyo&#8221; is available for digital distribution&#8230; RIGHT NOW!</p>
<p>It was July 7th, 2011, when Lia released a single album for the victims of the tsunami and recorded an intense version of &#8220;Kimi Wa Hitori Nankaja Naiyo&#8221; (&#8220;You&#8217;re Not Alone&#8221;) in one take on piano. That attempt became &#8220;Song of Life&#8221;, an album made of tracks inspired by the themes of &#8220;hope&#8221; and &#8220;life&#8221; in honor of the victims of the 3/11 tsunami and earthquake.</p>
<p>On the other hand, IA&#8217;s cover of &#8220;Kimi Wa Hitori Nankaja Naiyo&#8221; is produced in a totally different style, an acapella performance that you can&#8217;t miss!</p>
<p>Last but not least!<br />
The revenue of the sales of Lia&#8217;s original version and IA&#8217;s cover of &#8220;Kimi Wa Hitori Nankaja Naiyo&#8221; will be donated to the foundation <a href="http://michinoku-mirai.org/">Michinoku Mirai</a> (公益財団法人 みちのく未来基金), which helps the young victims of the tsunami to continue their studies.</p>
<p>Good music x Good action!</p>
<h5><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-6146 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/KIMIWAHITORINANKA-1.jpg" alt="KIMIWAHITORINANKA" width="329" height="329" />Hoshi&#8217;s Review</h5>
<p>It&#8217;s not often that we get to listen to an actual VOCALOID song where the VOCALOID is the only instrument used. But &#8220;Kimi Wa Hitori Nankaja Naiyo&#8221; proves that doing so can lead to absolutely amazing results. IA provides the main and backing vocals perfectly, and despite not being human, manages to bring a good amount of human emotion to the song. One can hear the changes in her voice and, much like Lia&#8217;s version, hers manages to pull a hugely emotional response from me as well. And this is featuring nothing but IA&#8217;s vocals.</p>
<p>The song is just as beautiful as Lia&#8217;s version if not more so as the focus on IA&#8217;s voice brings incredible attention to what she&#8217;s singing. I can listen to it over and over again and continue hearing new things that I missed the first time. It&#8217;s truly a work of art and I would recommend this to any VOCALOID fan. It&#8217;s a technical masterpiece as well as an artistic one.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to listen for yourself before buying, 1st Place does allow you to listen to the first minute and a half of the song on iTunes.</p>
<h5>Where to Buy</h5>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/kimi-wa-hitori-nankaja-naiyo/id1097002080" target="_blank">Purchase on iTunes</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, the song is only available on iTunes with the price varying depending on the location. You can also purchase Lia&#8217;s version on iTunes <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/kimi-wa-hitori-nankaja-naiyo/id1086546156" target="_blank">here</a> if you&#8217;re interested. Remember that all proceeds for both songs do go to Michinoku Mirai. So not only do you get great music but also you get to help a great cause as well!</p>
