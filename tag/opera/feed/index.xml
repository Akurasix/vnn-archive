										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world&#8217;s first VOCALOID Opera, <em>The End</em>, made its debut in 2013. Since then, it&#8217;s traveled the world to countries including France and Germany and was even displayed on a beach. And now, in October of this year, the show will have its Australian premier at the <a href="http://www.ozasiafestival.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OzAsia Festival</a> in Adelaide.</p>
<p>Conceived and composed by Japanese composer (and Miku fan) <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/4670" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keiichiro Shibuya</a>, the show features the vocals of <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/4670" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hatsune Miku</a>, costume designs by Louis Vuitton and visual design by YKBX. Unlike many Miku productions, <em>The End </em>focuses on slightly darker themes as Miku struggles to understand her existence and if she&#8217;s like other humans.</p>
<h3>Promotional Video</h3>
<p>The Adelaide Festival Centre provided a video to give fans an idea of what to expect! It also gives fans a taste of the amazing visuals in this virtual opera.</p>

<h3>About &#8220;THE END&#8221;</h3>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/165872071" width="618" height="348" frameborder="0" title="Keiichiro Shibuya &amp; Hatsune Miku: The End" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Translated from the German description:</p>
<p>This first virtual pop-opera in the world is a spectacular, synaesthetic, overwhelming, and touching confrontation with the death wish of a digital superstar.</p>
<p>With more than 100,000 songs, over 170,000 YouTube videos, a big U.S. tour, and a global fan base, the turquoise-haired girl, Hatsune Miku, from Japan is one of the biggest international pop stars. The only difference from Beyoncé and other stars: Hatsune Miku is a virtual 3D-figure whose songs are made by her fans. She was released in 2007 and, since then, users have been writing songs using her voice.</p>
<p>One of her fans is Keichiiro Shibuya, one of the most famous young composers of piano and electronic music. With songs based on lyrics of the Japanese theater renovator Toshiki Okada, Shibuya composed an opera for Hatsune Miku, which highlights synthetic music and the latest animation technology. Hatsune Miku will be larger than life and dressed in costumes from Louis Vuitton while projected on a setting consisting of several screens. All the while, Shibuya will be live on stage accompanying her singing.</p>
<h3>More Information</h3>
<p>More information is available in German on the <a href="http://www.kampnagel.de/de/programm/the-end/" target="_blank">Kampnagel website</a>. In addition, there is a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1581505395483412/" target="_blank">Facebook event</a> up as well.</p>
<p>Should any more information come up, we&#8217;ll be sure to let fans know!</p>
