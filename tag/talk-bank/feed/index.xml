										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Onseogosei no Seiyujimusha, translated as &#8220;Voice Synth Voice Actors&#8217; Office&#8221; is far from new, they have a rather new addition that&#8217;s bringing the series of voice banks to new levels! In addition to their many talking voice banks, they now have a singing voice bank unlike any other.</p>
<h3>About Onseogosei no Seiyujimusha</h3>
<p>As mentioned, Onseogosei no Seiyujimusha translates to &#8220;Voice Synth Voice Actors&#8217; Office.&#8221; It&#8217;s a series of voice banks with a little bit of plot surrounding them. These banks are all members of an office and work to serve those who hire them.</p>
<p>Their introduction even sounds like an office secretary wrote it!</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8216;Onseogosei no Seiyujimusha&#8217; is a voice synth project that started in 2017 and is celebrating its first anniversary come this spring. Our voice synth software, which is capable of expressing emotions, will work hard to fit your needs!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>About the Software</h3>

<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cover_logo-1.png'><img width="300" height="137" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cover_logo-1-300x137.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cover_logo-1-300x137.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cover_logo-1.png 522w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>

<p>Onseogosei no Seiyujimusha utilizes the VoiceText engine by HOYA CORPORATION. Unfortunately, at this time, it&#8217;s only available commercially. However, there&#8217;s always a chance that this will change in the future!</p>
<p>The software&#8217;s official page advertises four special features of voice text: Emotion, Making Original Voices, Changing How the Voices Talk, and the Singing Synthesizer. The following points are translated from the website. Please note that the translations have been changed slightly to make more sense in English.</p>
<h5>Point 1: Emotion</h5>
<p>With VoiceText, happy, sad, and angry emotions are available. Through expression settings, you can control the strength and weakness of the voice. Through the emotions settings, you can control the strength of emotions. This allows you to have the phrase sound however you&#8217;d like it to. This makes for fun conversations featuring voices that don&#8217;t sound like robots but like humans.</p>
<h5>Point 2: Making Original Voices</h5>
<p>You can create your own original voice synth by recording your own voice or the voice of a voice actor. You can even revive the voice of people who have passed away. In addition to creating the voice itself and giving it emotions, you can attach special sentence-enders to all the sentences (like a cat ending every sentence with &#8220;Nyan!&#8221;). You can find an in-depth tutorial (in Japanese) <a href="http://voicetext.jp/products/vt-original/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h5>Point 3: Changing How They Talk</h5>
<p>You can combine a character&#8217;s voice with another character&#8217;s speaking style. You can combine characters with different accents to create new ways of speaking or combining two voices to make them cuter. Perfect for people who want a different voice from those provided.</p>
<h5>Singing Synthesizer</h5>
<p>You input the melody and lyrics, and create a song. Unlike other vocal synths, it doesn&#8217;t go by one sound at a time but instead uses a statistical model to create smooth and clear singing. It has the warmth of a human being singing.</p>
<p>They are using a new style of singing voice synthesis technology developed mainly by Professor Keiichi Tokuda of Nagoya Institute of Technology, and speech analysis and synthesis system <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/transinf/E99.D/7/E99.D_2015EDP7457/_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WORLD</a> developed by Professor Masanori Morise of Yamanashi University.</p>
<h3>The Characters</h3>
<p>At the moment, there are 11 characters capable of speaking — one of whom is debuting as an idol. Unless otherwise stated, the voice is capable of happy, sad, and angry emotions.</p>
<h4>The Newcomer Idol</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, we reported on an <a href="/new-member-introduction-pv-hints-at-possible-new-otomachi-una-voicebank/" target="_blank">interesting teaser</a> featuring Una. At the time, we didn&#8217;t know what it was, but there were quite a few guesses. Now, we finally have the answer! Otomachi Una Talk will be released on April 20th!</p>
<h3>Otomachi Una Talk</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pake_f.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-90921 size-medium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pake_f-103x300.jpg" alt="" width="103" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pake_f-103x300.jpg 103w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pake_f.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px" /></a> Una Talk, much like Sugar and Spicy, has her own design. However, unlike the previous two, this Una appears far more casual and less like a performer. Her glasses, little cap, and casual but still Una-esque outfit, all make this feel like a very natural version of Una, which is fitting for a talk voice! She looks very scholarly and definitely seems like she&#8217;d be comfortable talking quite a bit.</p>
<p>Una Talk uses a different speech software from Megpoid Talk. While Megpoid Talk uses FineSpeech, Una Talk uses the AITalk software. Due to this, the two will have different results in clarity and quality.</p>
<h3>Demo</h3>
<p>Otomachi Una Talk currently has one official demo by <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/1226">KurageP</a>, titled &#8220;BEAST DANCE.&#8221;<br />
<iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mH-PbzzRFsg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
In addition, it&#8217;s probably safe to say that the member introduction video features Una Talk.</p>
<p>You can also try her out yourself on her <a href="http://www.ssw.co.jp/products/talk/una/index.html" target="_blank">product page</a>! Simply input Japanese text into the box and she&#8217;ll read it back to you!</p>
<h3>Prices and Release Date</h3>
<p>Otomachi<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pa.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-90951" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pa.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="239" /></a> Una Talk is set to release both digitally and physically on April 20th, 2017.</p>
