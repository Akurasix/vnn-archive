					<h5>Using Amazon</h5>
<p>Amazon follows a similar rule set with a few extra features you need to be aware of.</p>
<figure id="attachment_8312" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8312" style="width: 585px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/AzonBootleg.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-8312" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/AzonBootleg.jpg" alt="Example of &quot;China Version&quot; in description." width="585" height="475" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/AzonBootleg.jpg 977w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/06/AzonBootleg-300x244.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8312" class="wp-caption-text">Example of &#8220;China Version&#8221; used in a description. Also, that&#8217;s one pricey bootleg.</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>&#8220;Fulfilled by Amazon&#8221; does not guarantee a legit product. </strong>There have been stories of people buying a product from someone because it was &#8220;Fulfilled by Amazon,&#8221; meaning the item was in Amazon&#8217;s warehouse. While one would think that people wouldn&#8217;t store their bootlegs right under Amazon&#8217;s nose, they will.</p>
<p><strong>However, customer service is very, very strict and they will help you if you manage to get a bootleg. </strong>If you order a figure and receive a bootleg, contact customer service. Usually, they&#8217;ll get you a refund and help you with everything else. Same goes for if your figure comes broken.</p>
<p><strong>But don&#8217;t use this as a safety net. </strong> Imagine you&#8217;re Amazon and you&#8217;ve received several emails from a single customer who seems to constantly say they purchased a bootleg. Even if every figure is actually a bootleg, there will still be penalties. Amazon has been known to ban people who request too many returns/exchanges.</p>
<p><strong>There are sometimes packaging issues. </strong>Anyone who bought the <em>Project Mirai DX</em> game from Amazon knows there was a slight problem with the packaging where the outside cardboard box that held the clip and the AR cards got crushed because Amazon packed the games in bubble envelopes. According to people who have bought figures from Amazon, their items often come with a little bit of damage to the figure boxes. While this isn&#8217;t a huge problem for some, anyone who wants a mint condition box should look at who&#8217;s fulfilling the order. If Amazon is, you&#8217;ll probably want to steer clear.</p>
<p>However, I recently found a figure on sale from someone who packed the item themselves. Usually, people who ship figures know how much we love the boxes and will try their hardest to protect the packaging.</p>
<h5>Buying from Facebook Pages</h5>
<p>No. Don&#8217;t do it. Ever. Even if they are claiming to have pre-orders of authentic products, don&#8217;t do it. If they don&#8217;t even have a website and are running off of a Facebook page but can somehow afford all of these figures (and not even a storefront), they are bad news. Just don&#8217;t buy figures from Facebook pages.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing if a figure seller has a Facebook page that talks about their products and gives a link to their website. But if you see a page that just shows pictures and gives you the price, don&#8217;t do it.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve purchased both used and new figures from Amazon and eBay in the past and have received real figures. Using the guidelines above, it is possible to find real figures on those two websites. I don&#8217;t discourage you from using them if you&#8217;re looking for a certain figure, but I do encourage you to shop wisely. Use this knowledge to avoid drowning in bootlegs.</p>
<p>This likely won&#8217;t keep you from ever purchasing a bootleg as the bootleg sellers are getting more and more slick as the years go by, but knowing the red flags should help you avoid obvious ones.</p>
<p>This is a guide created by a fan and is in no way associated with any figure company or specific figure distributor. Following these guidelines will help you to avoid bootleg figures, but there is no guarantee that following the guide will result in you never receiving a bootleg.</p>

If not, you may want to check out our first article in the Figure Collecting series to get an idea of just what the figure collecting world has to offer. The only downfall? Bootleg figures.\n\nBut fear not, we're here to help you navigate the world of horrible reproductions and even those sneaky bootlegs that can fool the untrained eye.\n\nWhat's a Bootleg Figure and Why are Bootlegs Bad?\n\n\n\nA bootleg figure is one that isn't made by the manufacturer. Due to this, they often lack the quality of the official products. This isn't the only reason to not buy bootlegs though. They also don't support the companies behind the figure and sales don't go towards the total sales of the product.\n\nSay you buy a bootleg version of the upcoming MEIKO figma. Now this is the first time she's getting any kind of figure since her Nendoroid release, so it's even more important than usual. The figma sales are really going to help determine just what MEIKO will get in the future. By buying a bootleg, that's one less sale counted when every sale counts. Now multiply that by several hundred at the very least and several hundred thousand or more at the most. Crypton sees less money being made and stops focusing on MEIKO because Miku, Rin, and Len can get them more money.\n\nThe same goes for any bootleg purchase. By buying a bootleg, you're telling figure companies that you would rather buy a lower quality figure than put money towards one they've worked hard on. Bootlegs are a slap in the face to figure manufacturers and the companies that allow their characters to be turned into figures.\n\nHow to Identify A Bootleg\n\nSometimes it's easy to point at a figure and go \"That's a bootleg.\" Other times, it's a bit more complicated.\n\nDead Giveaways\n\nHere are a few dead giveaways to look for when purchasing:\n\nThe paint job is bad at best and completely wrong at the worst. Ever seen MEIKO with yellow hair? Not on any official merchandise.\n\n\n\nThe sculpt is wrong. There is no way to describe the horror of some bootlegs. Whether it is horribly off or just slightly wrong, bootlegs often don't look like their legit counterparts. As Good Smile Company moves production of their figures to Japan, it gets harder to make bootlegs, since no one can grab the left-over cast used to create the figure.\n\nMissing or added items. Sometimes, bootlegs fail to come with all of the items that the original should, and other times, they come with more. If possible, look up the figure you're buying to see what it comes with and compare it to what you can see in the box. Should you be buying online, you can compare photos of the listing to photos on the official product page.\n\nNendoroids that aren't pose-able. This seems to be the theme of quite a large amount of bootlegs nowadays. The people making the fakes will make figures with no moving parts and poses based on the product photos Good Smile Company provides. Nendoroids don't work like that. Ever.\n\n \n\n\n\nBrand new and super cheap. Unless someone is desperate to quickly downsize their collection, you'll rarely find a brand new figure for dirt cheap. There are some exceptions to this rule (such as unpopular figures that stores are trying to get off their shelves) but the usual rule is if the figure is being sold on somewhere like Ebay for way under market value and it's brand new, don't go for it.\n\nNOTE: Prize machine figures are very inexpensive. If you're looking at a prize machine figure and it's at a low price, that's  normal. Very rarely will prize machine figures go for more than $20 USD while they're available in machines. \n\nThe box has the wrong name. This one is pretty much self explanatory. If you're buying a Sakura Miku figure and it says \"Snow Miku 2015,\" it's a bootleg. If they misspell Miku, it's a bootleg. If they say you're buying a League of Legends figure and there's a VOCALOID in the box, it's a bootleg.\n\nTake the box on the right as one of the worst bootlegs you could ever find. We have the GSC and Hatsune Miku logos, but there's also large text reading \"XINXHIDA\" and \"FOR THE LEAGUE OF LEGENDS.\" And despite Miku not looking anything like Santa, the English text says that she is indeed \"Hatsune Miku Santa Ver.\"\n\nSometimes bootleggers don't even try.  Though other times they're pretty good at fooling the untrained eye.\n\n \n\nSmaller Details\n\n\n\nOnce you open the box and get a good look at the contents (or see pictures of the opened figure online), there are some smaller details that can hint at whether or not you picked up a bootleg. One of the biggest signs of a bootleg is missing copyright information. EVERY Nendoroid and figma stand has copyright information on it.\n\n\n\nFor Nendoroids, the copyright information is printed on the front of the stand where it's very visible. Figmas, on the other hand, have the text printed on the bottom of the stand.\n\nIn addition to the missing print, you've also likely noticed that the bootleg figma stand is rather murky. Though stands are not always perfectly see through (they may be slightly translucent), they never look muddy or have random specks on them.\n\n\n\nShould opening the box not be an option, just looking at it can give you a few clues. Oftentimes, the boxes themselves will either have missing details or be completely wrong. If you're looking to buy a figure from someone other than a trusted dealer, make sure you know what the box looks like!\n\nExamples include missing shiny parts, a completely wrong texture (Nendoroid Sakura Bloom: Bloomed in Japan Version has a rice paper-like texture to the box. So far, no bootlegs have this.), missing pictures or information, or even just a missing holographic sticker.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Not all figures have holographic stickers on their boxes. If the item has been released already, you can check Bootleg Finders on My Figure Collection when in doubt. Recently, I haven't seen any figures with holographic stickers on the boxes. \n\n\n\n\nAvoiding Bootleg Figures Online\n\nWhen you're buying the item at a convention or a store, you can look at the box and inspect every little bit of it to make sure things check out. With modern technology, you can even search up details on the figure in question right on the spot. But when you're buying online, things get quite a bit trickier. You don't get to see the product in person until it gets to your door and, at that point, it could be too late. So how does one avoid bootlegs online?\n\n\n\nWhen possible, buy from trusted sources.\n\neBay and Amazon should be the last place you venture to for figures unless you're either looking for a used item or a really old figure. This is due to those websites being made of far too many vendors to count and it taking much longer to find a legit seller.\n\nOfficial Online Shop Assuming the item is still up for pre-order, the obvious bet is to go to the official online shop selling the item.\n\nGSC Partner Shops Good Smile Company has a list of partner shops available on their website. These shops span all over the world and are guaranteed to sell legit GSC merchandise. You can trust them to not sell bootlegs at all as GSC will not partner with shops that sell bootlegs of any kind.\n\nIn addition, these shops also tend to sell out of less popular figures rather slowly. As of the time of this article, many of these stores still had various older Nendoroids and even scaled figures dating back to 2011 releases.\n\nOther Trusted Sources If you missed the Good Smile Online Shop pre-order but the item hasn't been released yet, AmiAmi is a great place to check. And, if you're lucky, you may find a previously released figure that hasn't sold out yet. They do sell pre-owned figures, though, so check before you buy! (The pre-owned items are clearly marked as such.)\n\nMandarake is a great place to go if you're looking for used or prize figures. The only issues are that you can't combine orders, so the shipping can get very pricey, and their stock changes all the time, so there's no guarantee of you getting the figure you're looking for.\n\nUsing Ebay\n\nSometimes, eBay is just easier. The figure could be old or you're looking to buy it used because it's just cheaper that way. You still need to be careful, though, as eBay is filled with a plethora of bootlegs that will easily bury the real figures.\n\nWhen the item has a billion names in the title. A trustworthy seller doesn't put every possible keyword in the title of the listing. A good listing will have the name of the figure and possibly the name of the company that created it. No words like \"cute\" or, in the case of VOCALOID figures, \"anime,\" should appear. (Although calling VOCALOID \"anime\" for the sake of having the figures show up in other searches seems to have become popular even in Japan.)\n\n\n\nCheck the seller rating. This is a hit or miss but can help you a little bit. Overall, it seems that most people who buy bootlegs nowadays know what they're getting. But if you peek at the Neutral and Negative feedback and see even a few people complaining of issues like poor paint jobs, figures coming without a box, and items that either broke the moment they were touched or came broken, you're likely looking at a bootleg seller.\n\n\n\nCheck what the seller sells. Are they selling everything from car parts to figures? You probably shouldn't buy from them. Your best bet is to look for someone that focuses on figures and similar merchandise. Always keep in mind all of our tips though. Finding someone who just sells figures could mean you found someone who just sells bootleg figures.\n\nAlways look for \"China Version\" in the description. Even if the name of the item has \"Good Smile Company,\" \"Bandai,\" or any other company name in it, ALWAYS CHECK THE DESCRIPTION. The newest trick bootleggers use to rip people off and make sure that they keep their money is by adding \"China Version\" or something of that nature to the item description. This way, when people file a claim, the bootleg seller can say \"I told them it was the China Version and not the official one.\" If it says \"China Version,\" don't buy it. This also includes \"Official China Version\" and any other variant.\n\nAlso look for \"Authentic Version.\" \"Authentic Japanese Version,\" \"Authentic Japanese Product,\" or anything else of that nature works as well. Very rarely will a seller say their item is authentic and then sell a bootleg. That's one thing that will definitely get them in trouble. (Following the \"China Version\" warning, though, don't buy an \"Authentic Chinese Version.\")\n\nLook at the pictures provided. If they're using stock photos from the company website, ask to see pictures of the product itself if you're not convinced. And even if they're providing pictures of the item, don't fully trust the seller until you do a quick image search. You'll see bootleggers often use the same picture everywhere and sometimes it's even stolen. Some legit sellers will use stock photos for one reason or another, but they're usually happy to provide pictures of their item, especially if you're interested in it.\n\nRemember the other rules. If a Halloween Miku figure is going for $16.00 USD, there's a problem. If a Snow Miku figure is up for purchase before the Winter Wonfes release, you're probably looking at a bootleg. And if the picture(s) provided look(s) like a bootleg, it's a bootleg.\n\nWhen in doubt, MFC may help. My Figure Collection has a list of bootleg sellers as well as a list of sellers who members trust. These lists are, of course, not complete and never will be. But they're a great resource to go to.\n\nThis is not a checklist. While these are all signs of a bootleg, I'm not going to say these are all of the signs. Don't use this as a checklist to make sure everything is perfect. You need to use your best judgement when purchasing figures online. This list is simply some of the giant red flags you should look for.\n\n\n\nUsing Amazon\n\nAmazon follows a similar rule set with a few extra features you need to be aware of.\n\n\n\n\"Fulfilled by Amazon\" does not guarantee a legit product. There have been stories of people buying a product from someone because it was \"Fulfilled by Amazon,\" meaning the item was in Amazon's warehouse. While one would think that people wouldn't store their bootlegs right under Amazon's nose, they will.\n\nHowever, customer service is very, very strict and they will help you if you manage to get a bootleg. If you order a figure and receive a bootleg, contact customer service. Usually, they'll get you a refund and help you with everything else. Same goes for if your figure comes broken.\n\nBut don't use this as a safety net.  Imagine you're Amazon and you've received several emails from a single customer who seems to constantly say they purchased a bootleg. Even if every figure is actually a bootleg, there will still be penalties. Amazon has been known to ban people who request too many returns\/exchanges.\n\nThere are sometimes packaging issues. Anyone who bought the Project Mirai DX game from Amazon knows there was a slight problem with the packaging where the outside cardboard box that held the clip and the AR cards got crushed because Amazon packed the games in bubble envelopes. According to people who have bought figures from Amazon, their items often come with a little bit of damage to the figure boxes. While this isn't a huge problem for some, anyone who wants a mint condition box should look at who's fulfilling the order. If Amazon is, you'll probably want to steer clear.\n\nHowever, I recently found a figure on sale from someone who packed the item themselves. Usually, people who ship figures know how much we love the boxes and will try their hardest to protect the packaging.\n\nBuying from Facebook Pages\n\nNo. Don't do it. Ever. Even if they are claiming to have pre-orders of authentic products, don't do it. If they don't even have a website and are running off of a Facebook page but can somehow afford all of these figures (and not even a storefront), they are bad news. Just don't buy figures from Facebook pages.\n\nIt's one thing if a figure seller has a Facebook page that talks about their products and gives a link to their website. But if you see a page that just shows pictures and gives you the price, don't do it.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nI've purchased both used and new figures from Amazon and eBay in the past and have received real figures. Using the guidelines above, it is possible to find real figures on those two websites. I don't discourage you from using them if you're looking for a certain figure, but I do encourage you to shop wisely. Use this knowledge to avoid drowning in bootlegs.\n\nThis likely won't keep you from ever purchasing a bootleg as the bootleg sellers are getting more and more slick as the years go by, but knowing the red flags should help you avoid obvious ones.\n\nThis is a guide created by a fan and is in no way associated with any figure company or specific figure distributor. Following these guidelines will help you to avoid bootleg figures, but there is no guarantee that following the guide will result in you never receiving a bootleg.\n\n\n\nFeature Image Art by: Chiku\nBootleg vs Real Images by: Good Smile Company","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/BootlegFiguresFeature2.png","width":1430,"height":796}}</script>
