					<h3>Nendoroid Co-De</h3>
<figure id="attachment_81301" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-81301" style="width: 286px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Ha2neCoDe.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-81301" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Ha2neCoDe.jpg" alt="" width="286" height="286" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Ha2neCoDe.jpg 650w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Ha2neCoDe-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Ha2neCoDe-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 286px) 100vw, 286px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-81301" class="wp-caption-text">Hatsune Miku &#8211; Ha2ne Miku Co-de</figcaption></figure>
<p>Nendoroid Co-De figures can be considered Budget Nendoroids. While they&#8217;re the tiny size of a Nendo and have the same body type as one, they don&#8217;t come with all the extra parts nor do they have the ability to change out parts as freely as regular Nendoroids. This leads to a much cheaper price.</p>
<p>However, they still do have some customization options. The four parts of each Co-De can be switched freely to create different combinations. There is also a small range of motion available via the head which can turn.</p>
<p>These figures will usually cost  ¥2,778 JPY or approximately $27 USD.  The only VOCALOID Co-De that breaks this pattern is the <a href="https://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/5653/Nendoroid+Co+de+Hatsune+Miku+Red+Feather+Community+Chest+Movement+70th+Anniversary+Commemoration+Co+de.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Feather Community Chest Miku Co-De</a> which cost a bit more at ¥3,241 JPY or about $32 USD. You can find the official page for the Nendoroid Co-De line <a href="https://www.goodsmile.info/en/aboutcode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h5>Pros</h5>
<p><strong>Great for Entry Level Collectors.</strong> If you want to start small and cheap but still high quality, Nendoroid Co-De figures are definitely a great option. They let you get a feel for collecting high quality figures without that high price tag that usually comes along with them.</p>
<p><strong>Price.</strong> At less that $30 USD for one (before shipping), it&#8217;s a good quality figure for a pretty cheap price.</p>
<p><strong>Easy to Manage.</strong> Unlike Nendoroids, there aren&#8217;t a ton of small parts that you can lose. This once again makes these figures great for people who want to get a feel for collecting or just people who don&#8217;t have any more room to store extra Nendoroid and figma Parts.</p>
<p><strong>Still Pretty Customizable.</strong> Despite not having the full range of options that Nendoroids do, you still can switch things up and even mix and match parts with your Nendoroids and Co-Des outside of the VOCALOID line.</p>
<figure id="attachment_81314" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-81314" style="width: 557px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/code_explain_image.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-81314" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/code_explain_image.png" alt="" width="557" height="395" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/code_explain_image.png 557w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/code_explain_image-300x213.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-81314" class="wp-caption-text">Source: <a href="https://www.goodsmile.info/en/nendoro-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Good Smile Company</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Each Co-De comes with four parts: Their head, their shirt/top, their skirt, and their legs. The parts can be mixed and matched amongst Co-De figures with ease, leading to a wide range of possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Easy to Display.</strong> Anyone who owns Nendoroids will tell you smaller parts like a microphone can sometimes be torture to put in a Nendo&#8217;s hands. Co-De figures come out of the box with nice poses that require zero effort.</p>
<p><strong>Availability.</strong> Much like Nendoroids, the Co-De figures are pretty easy to get ahold of even after they&#8217;ve been released. Many stores are even selling this relatively cheap figures for pretty good prices!</p>
<h5>Middle</h5>
<p><strong>Pose-able to a degree.</strong> As mentioned, these figures can move their heads but that&#8217;s about it. They were made to be cheaper and easier to manage than Nendoroids so there isn&#8217;t a ton of points taken off for this. It may just seem a bit odd to a seasoned Nendoroid collector when their Nendoroids are almost as stiff as scales.</p>
<h5>Cons</h5>
<p><strong>Character Selection.</strong> So far, most of the VOCALOID Co-De figures are of Miku with a single Len figure making the cut as well. If you want even one of the other Crypton characters, you&#8217;re out of luck for the moment.</p>
<h3>figmas</h3>
<figure id="attachment_1222" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1222" style="width: 270px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RacingMikufigma2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1222 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RacingMikufigma2.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="393"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1222" class="wp-caption-text">figma Racing Miku: 2015 ver.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The figma line is best described as a mashup between ball-jointed dolls and detailed scale figures. Figmas have neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle joints as well as a movable torso to support better posing. And, of course, the Miku figmas come with movable twin tails.</p>
<p>Much like Nendoroids, figmas are quite capable of being customized. Face plates can be swapped and the many joints allow for lots of different poses. Figmas often come with props as well as extra hand parts to allow for even more expression.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of figmas, they often come with fewer parts than Nendoroids. But if one was to remove the extra leg and arm parts needed for posing Nendos, they would see the two are rather even in terms of extra parts.</p>
<p>Price wise, figmas will set you back more than most of the other options. Though older figmas (such as the Luka one) range between $20 and $30 USD, the newer ones are usually between $40 and $80 USD.</p>
<p>The most expensive figmas are the Racing Miku ones, which can only be obtained through Good Smile Racing personal sponsorship pledges. As of 2015, the cheapest figma course is $80 USD.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1240" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1240" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/figmaKAITO.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1240 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/figmaKAITO.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="522"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1240" class="wp-caption-text">figma KAITO</figcaption></figure>
<h5>Pros</h5>
<p><strong>Most Pose-able. </strong>When it comes to the number of poses you can put figures in, figmas by far take the lead. Their many joints allow for infinite possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Customizable. </strong>Much like Nendoroids, figmas are capable of being customized. Face plates can be switched out as well as hands and even full heads. Accessories are also exchangeable among the figma line.</p>
<p><strong>Realistic.</strong> As mentioned before, figmas can be thought of as a mix between ball-jointed dolls and scale figures. While figmas are not necessarily made to a scale compared to the character, they are made to a scale compared to the human body.</p>
<p>While proportions are skewed slightly to fit the anime style, this simply makes it seem like the character has come to life in the real world.</p>
<p><strong>Free Standing (to a Point). </strong>While figmas are modeled after humans, they aren&#8217;t human. A figma can stand on its own two feet so long as it is balanced properly but can&#8217;t stand in complex poses without its base.</p>
<p>Once again, we recommend that you display your figure with its stand. Though a figma can stand on its own, it&#8217;s far sturdier when there is a stand supporting it.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1244" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1244" style="width: 329px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/figmaSnowMiku.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1244 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/figmaSnowMiku.jpg" alt="" width="329" height="354"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1244" class="wp-caption-text">figma Snow Miku</figcaption></figure>
<h5>Cons</h5>
<p><strong>Visible Joints. </strong>The thing that turns people off from figmas the most is that the series has some rather visible joints. Though some can be hidden by long sleeves or blend in more thanks to wrinkles in the &#8220;clothing&#8221;, many joints cannot be hidden.</p>
<p>The knee and ankle joints are usually the ones that stick out in VOCALOID figmas the most but elbow joints can also cause a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Characters.</strong> So far, most of the figmas made have been of Miku. There were <a href="https://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/2896/figma+Luka+Megurine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luka</a>, <a href="https://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/8/figma+Rin+Kagamine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rin</a>, and <a href="https://www.goodsmile.info/en/product/9/figma+Len+Kagamine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Len</a> figmas made before figmas were updated. Since then, KAITO has seen a single release. Most of the VOCALOID figmas are Racing Miku figmas. However, Good Smile Company seems to be releasing a Snow Miku figma each year from now on as well.</p>

Yet despite wanting to start their collections, many fans simply don't know where to start. This guide will help you start your VOCALOID figure collecting journey. However, it can be applied to figures in general as well.\n\nUpdate Notes: Since this article was originally published, more options have come out and others have seen updates. As such, we've updated the article to reflect these.\n\n\n\nDeciding Where to Start\n\nThe first thing any beginning collector needs to decide is what their budget is. Are you ready to shell out $200 USD or is your budget more like $20?\n\nOnce you decide that, you need to determine what type of figure you're looking for. Do you want something small and cute? Pose-able or still? Super detailed or more simplistic?\n\nAfter those questions are answered, it's very easy to figure out where you'd like to begin. In the following sections, we'll cover each type of figure from their prices to sizes and the pros and cons of each.\n\n\n\nNendoroid Petites\n\n\n\nNendoroid Petites are small figures with limited posing ability. They are essentially mini Nendoroids with less articulation. Just like Nendos, Nendoroid Petites are capable of having bodies, face plates, and other parts swapped around to other Petites (minus a few special circumstances). Some Petites are now even coming with more than one face plate so that they can have different expressions.\n\nThese are usually sold as both full sets online and blind boxes at conventions and other events. A single Petite will usually cost no more than $8 USD* while the full sets range in price depending on how many figures there are. The Hatsune Miku Selection set retailed for ¥7,200 in the Good Smile Company online shop.  The newer Hatsune Miku Renewal set also retailed for the same price.\n\nUnfortunately, there haven't been any VOCALOID Petite sets released. The second to last set (Hatsune Miku Selection) was released in 2013 while the latest Renewal set came three years later in 2016.\n\n*This price can be quite a bit higher depending on if the Petite is bundled with something of higher value. The Racing Miku 2012 Nendoroid Petit retailed for ¥2,000 because the Petite came with a motorized car Miku could ride in.\n\n\n\nPros\n\nCost. Though many figures go up in price as time goes on, Nendoroid Petites from the sets can usually still be found for a good price. They rarely go over $15 USD and less popular characters usually never reach over $10 USD.\n\nMany Characters. A lot of the options listed don't include many characters. Nendoroid Petites are limited to the VOCALOIDs (and derivatives) owned by Crypton but that's a lot more characters than many of the other options have.\n\nSmall. If you want to start small, Petites are the way to go. They're around 65mm in height which makes it easy to collect quite a few without taking up too much space.\n\nCustomizable. Though not as customizable as Nendoroids and figmas, Petites can have face plates changed. In addition, body swaps and other options are available. This gives them some extra character that rigid figures cannot provide.\n\n\n\nCons\n\nBuying them. If you're looking for VOCALOID Nendoroid Petites, you're going to have to buy them pre-owned or hope you can find them from a reputable dealer at a convention. Even then, they'll likely be selling blind boxes and you'll be forced to gamble.\n\nIn the event that a new set is released, you'll have to buy the full set online. If you want just a single character, it's difficult to get it.\n\nLack of Pose-ability. Petites have some mobility to them but not much. In a sense, they're almost like scaled down figures of Nendoroids. They can come apart but can't be posed like their larger counterparts.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNendoroid Plus\n\n\n\n\"Nendoroid Plus\" is a term used to cover everything from the Jumbo Nendoroid Petite Miku to Petites in pull-back cars. Plushes styled like Nendoroids and the \"~Snow Miku and Friends from the North~ SEASON 1\" figures also fall under this category. For this article, we'll be focusing on the \"Snow Miku and Friends from the North\" figures.\n\nThese were recently released in February 2015 and from the \"SEASON 1\" part of their name, we can assume there will be more to come in the future. Other Nendoroid Plus items either aren't quite figures (the pull-back cars) or are simply one of a kind (Jumbo Nendoroid Petite Miku).\n\n\n\nThese figures were originally sold during the 66th Sapporo Snow Festival in solid white capsules. You never knew what figure you got until you opened the capsule.\n\nThe capsules retailed for ¥463 each before tax and eventually made their way into animate shops, the Snow Miku cafe in Taiwan, Skytown in the New Chitose Airport, and even Anime Expo.\n\nOnly the heads and twin tails of these figures are moveable. The bodies have no moveable parts.\n\nAs for size, they are slightly smaller than Nendoroid Petites.\n\nHead joints on these Capsule Factory figures are compatible with Nendoroid Petites as well as other bodies in the set, allowing for some customization.\n\n\n\nPros\n\nCost. Much like the Nendoroid Petites, these figures are very cheap. Even buying them second hand will usually cost you no more than $10 USD. Even if you don't get the figure(s) you want the first time, you can afford several tries.\n\nSmall. You can easily display the whole first season of the \"Snow Miku and Friends from the North\" set on your desk or a small shelf.\n\nFree Standing. Some people are put off by the sight of figure stands, which are needed to hold up most figures. The set I've spoken about (future sets can not be spoken for) are all able to stand on their own. Miku's twin tails support the Miku figures while the Yukine one is supported by the trailing \"fabric\" of his bow.\n\nMiddle\n\nSimplicity. These are by far the simplest figures you can get. They have a very cartoonish feel to them that makes them unique and very charming. Though some may find this a con, it's definitely a positive for collectors looking to start small, or if they're looking for something insanely cute.\n\n\n\nCons\n\nBuying Them. Much like the Nendoroid Petites, these figures are also hard to come by. Unless you're lucky enough to go to an event that has the figures, you're going to struggle buying them first hand. And even then, they come in capsules and you have no choice as to which ones you get. There also has yet to be an option to buy them online or as a full set.\n\nLack of Characters. At the moment, the only Nendoroid Plus: Capsule Factory figures are of Rabbit Yukine and Miku. There are five (5) Miku figures and one (1) Rabbit Yukine.\n\nThough these are not pose-able, they do not look like pose-able figures. As such, lack of pose-ability isn't a con. \n\n\nNendoroids\n\n\n\nNendoroids are pose-able figures based on chibi styled versions of characters. These figures usually come in at about 100mm and aren't to scale.\n\nThey come with a plethora of parts that you can use to customize them and put them in various poses. There's always at least one other face plate available but it's more common to have two extra face plates.\n\nIn addition to the faces that allow changes in expression, extra parts often depend on the VOCALOID being depicted. Nendoroid Gackpo Kamui comes with swords, an eggplant he can ride, and different arms to allow posing him with his swords.\n\nSnow Miku 2014 came with various arm parts, an extra lower body that allows her to sit, two capes, a hat, and various props including Rabbit Yukine.\n\n\n\nThese extra parts are exchangeable between different Nendoroids and lead to unlimited options as one's collection grows.\n\nDue to this and the pose-ability of Nendoroids, many people photograph their Nendos in a variety of situations. And as more Nendoroid More products such as the pajamas and even wedding dresses and tuxedos are released, these figures will continue to become even more customizable.\n\nNendoroids are quite a bit more expensive than the Petites and Nendoroid Plus figures, usually retailing anywhere from 3,000 JPY (before tax) for a simple Nendo such as Snow Mikudayo up to over 4,000 JPY for more complex Nendoroids like Snow Miku 2014.\n\nThere are some that reach a higher price but this is the amount you can generally expect to pay.\n\n\n\nPros\n\n\n\nPose-ability. Nendoroids are some of the most pose-able figures out there, only beaten by figmas. The heads and legs are always ball jointed to allow a wide degree of movement. The arms are usually limited to forward and backward motions at the shoulders while the lower body can be rotated left to right. However, there are rarely any knee or elbow joints and their wrist \"joints\" are the same as the shoulder ones.\n\nThe lack of elbow and knee joints is often remedied by extra parts, however, and some Nendos like Snow Miku 2015 have ball-jointed shoulders.\n\n\"Hidden\" Joints. The lack of certain joints also makes a cleaner looking figure. One of the biggest cons for figmas is that their ball joints are often very visible. Nendoroids don't usually have this problem as their enlarged heads can hide the neck joint and the leg joints are usually hidden by their clothing. The shoulder and wrist \"joints\" aren't as noticeable due to not being ball joints. This creates a figure that looks very clean despite its mobility.\n\n\n\nSOME Are Freestanding. Though most Nendoroids aren't, the Hatsune Miku Nendoroids often have this special feature thanks to their long locks. Many of the Miku Nendos are capable of standing without the support of the square base and connecting arm so long as their hair is positioned in a way that supports their weight.\n\nNendoroids of other VOCALOIDs usually aren't able to do this and there are a few Miku Nendos that can't be supported by their hair.\n\nThere may be certain accessories like Gackpo's Eggplant that allow a Nendoroid to be posed without the stand but most don't come with such a prop.\n\nCustomizable. Every part of a Nendoroid can be swapped onto other Nendos. Would you like KAITO to wear a school girl uniform? Just stick Nendoroid KAITO's head onto a body wearing the uniform. Even face plates and hands are all compatible with other Nendoroids. The possibilities are endless.\n\n\n\nEasy to Obtain. Almost every VOCALOID Nendoroid is available in Good Smile Company's global online shop for pre-order before the release. The money is never taken out of your account until the product is ready to ship so you also have time to save up should a Nendoroid be released that you really want.\n\nIn the event that a Nendoroid isn't in the global shop due to various reasons, online shops like AmiAmi allow pre-orders. The only time obtaining a Nendoroid is difficult is when the Nendoroid isn't being sold in Japan. At those times, it's often being sold to a very limited set of countries. Thankfully, this doesn't happen often.\n\nShould you miss a pre-order, you can often find people selling used Nendoroids in almost perfect condition online.\n\nThe only time a Nendoroid is difficult to obtain is if it is from the Family Mart lotteries. Even then, they can usually be found for a decent price during the lottery so long as you aren't looking for the \"Last Prize\", a Nendoroid with a special design. Every Family Mart only gets a single \"Last Prize\" to be given out as the last prize in the lottery.\n\n\n\nGood Character Selection. In addition to the KAITO, Rin, Len, and Gackpo Nendoroids show, there are many Miku Nendos. There's also a Nendoroid GUMI, Nendoroid Lily from anim.o.v.e, Nendoroids of the Append models of Rin and Len, and even Luka and MEIKO Nendoroids.\n\nMiddle\n\nChibi Style. Due to the higher price of Nendoroids versus the Nendoroid Petites, some people aren't fond of the Chibi style. With the Petites, they find the style to be alright since the price is lower.\n\nHowever, there have been several people who have said they don't want to spend around $40 USD for a chibi.\n\n\n\nCons\n\nWhen They're Not Freestanding. The Nendoroid base seems to be the only con everyone can agree on. When Nendoroids are unable to stand on their own, they need to be supported by a base.\n\nThough there are ways to work around this for photography, it's not recommended that you use workarounds when simply displaying your figures. It's best that they have as much support as possible because their large heads make it very easy for them to topple over.\n\nSmall Parts. Although some find it easy to manage the tiny parts of Nendoroids, others find it extremely difficult. Getting hands to hold accessories or even switching out hands, or posing a Nendoroid a certain way can prove very difficult for those who lack the ability to handle small objects. And should you be unlucky enough to drop a part, good luck finding it!\n\nIn addition, these small parts often lead to breakage if one isn't careful. If something doesn't want to come out, don't force it. A hair dryer set on low is your friend when it comes to stubborn Nendo pieces. Always be gentle with your figure's parts.\n\n\nNendoroid Co-De\n\n\n\nNendoroid Co-De figures can be considered Budget Nendoroids. While they're the tiny size of a Nendo and have the same body type as one, they don't come with all the extra parts nor do they have the ability to change out parts as freely as regular Nendoroids. This leads to a much cheaper price.\n\nHowever, they still do have some customization options. The four parts of each Co-De can be switched freely to create different combinations. There is also a small range of motion available via the head which can turn.\n\nThese figures will usually cost  ¥2,778 JPY or approximately $27 USD.  The only VOCALOID Co-De that breaks this pattern is the Red Feather Community Chest Miku Co-De which cost a bit more at ¥3,241 JPY or about $32 USD. You can find the official page for the Nendoroid Co-De line here.\n\nPros\n\nGreat for Entry Level Collectors. If you want to start small and cheap but still high quality, Nendoroid Co-De figures are definitely a great option. They let you get a feel for collecting high quality figures without that high price tag that usually comes along with them.\n\nPrice. At less that $30 USD for one (before shipping), it's a good quality figure for a pretty cheap price.\n\nEasy to Manage. Unlike Nendoroids, there aren't a ton of small parts that you can lose. This once again makes these figures great for people who want to get a feel for collecting or just people who don't have any more room to store extra Nendoroid and figma Parts.\n\nStill Pretty Customizable. Despite not having the full range of options that Nendoroids do, you still can switch things up and even mix and match parts with your Nendoroids and Co-Des outside of the VOCALOID line.\n\n\n\nEach Co-De comes with four parts: Their head, their shirt\/top, their skirt, and their legs. The parts can be mixed and matched amongst Co-De figures with ease, leading to a wide range of possibilities.\n\nEasy to Display. Anyone who owns Nendoroids will tell you smaller parts like a microphone can sometimes be torture to put in a Nendo's hands. Co-De figures come out of the box with nice poses that require zero effort.\n\nAvailability. Much like Nendoroids, the Co-De figures are pretty easy to get ahold of even after they've been released. Many stores are even selling this relatively cheap figures for pretty good prices!\n\nMiddle\n\nPose-able to a degree. As mentioned, these figures can move their heads but that's about it. They were made to be cheaper and easier to manage than Nendoroids so there isn't a ton of points taken off for this. It may just seem a bit odd to a seasoned Nendoroid collector when their Nendoroids are almost as stiff as scales.\n\nCons\n\nCharacter Selection. So far, most of the VOCALOID Co-De figures are of Miku with a single Len figure making the cut as well. If you want even one of the other Crypton characters, you're out of luck for the moment.\n\nfigmas\n\n\n\nThe figma line is best described as a mashup between ball-jointed dolls and detailed scale figures. Figmas have neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle joints as well as a movable torso to support better posing. And, of course, the Miku figmas come with movable twin tails.\n\nMuch like Nendoroids, figmas are quite capable of being customized. Face plates can be swapped and the many joints allow for lots of different poses. Figmas often come with props as well as extra hand parts to allow for even more expression.\n\nDue to the nature of figmas, they often come with fewer parts than Nendoroids. But if one was to remove the extra leg and arm parts needed for posing Nendos, they would see the two are rather even in terms of extra parts.\n\nPrice wise, figmas will set you back more than most of the other options. Though older figmas (such as the Luka one) range between $20 and $30 USD, the newer ones are usually between $40 and $80 USD.\n\nThe most expensive figmas are the Racing Miku ones, which can only be obtained through Good Smile Racing personal sponsorship pledges. As of 2015, the cheapest figma course is $80 USD.\n\n\n\nPros\n\nMost Pose-able. When it comes to the number of poses you can put figures in, figmas by far take the lead. Their many joints allow for infinite possibilities.\n\nCustomizable. Much like Nendoroids, figmas are capable of being customized. Face plates can be switched out as well as hands and even full heads. Accessories are also exchangeable among the figma line.\n\nRealistic. As mentioned before, figmas can be thought of as a mix between ball-jointed dolls and scale figures. While figmas are not necessarily made to a scale compared to the character, they are made to a scale compared to the human body.\n\nWhile proportions are skewed slightly to fit the anime style, this simply makes it seem like the character has come to life in the real world.\n\nFree Standing (to a Point). While figmas are modeled after humans, they aren't human. A figma can stand on its own two feet so long as it is balanced properly but can't stand in complex poses without its base.\n\nOnce again, we recommend that you display your figure with its stand. Though a figma can stand on its own, it's far sturdier when there is a stand supporting it.\n\n\n\nCons\n\nVisible Joints. The thing that turns people off from figmas the most is that the series has some rather visible joints. Though some can be hidden by long sleeves or blend in more thanks to wrinkles in the \"clothing\", many joints cannot be hidden.\n\nThe knee and ankle joints are usually the ones that stick out in VOCALOID figmas the most but elbow joints can also cause a problem.\n\nLack of Characters. So far, most of the figmas made have been of Miku. There were Luka, Rin, and Len figmas made before figmas were updated. Since then, KAITO has seen a single release. Most of the VOCALOID figmas are Racing Miku figmas. However, Good Smile Company seems to be releasing a Snow Miku figma each year from now on as well.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPrize Machine Figures\n\n\n\nPrize Machine Figures (shortened to \"PM Figures\") are figures that can be won from claw machines in Japan.\n\nThese figures are manufactured in mass and as such, often don't have the quality of actual scale figures. However, due to their ability in prize machines, these figures are known for being cheap during their run in the machines.\n\nOnce the prize machines no longer have the figures in them, the price goes up. Price also depends on the rarity and popularity of said figures.\n\nUsually, these figures go for about $10 USD online during their run in machines. However, you can only get them from the machines and cannot buy them in stores. So all prize figures you buy will be pre-owned, even if they're brand new.\n\nFinding the figures actually isn't that difficult, either. Determined collectors can find their favorite prize figures years after the line is discontinued. And those who check websites frequently have no problem finding figures currently in prize machines.\n\nDespite these figures only coming from prize machines, they are all over the place online. This is thanks to skilled claw machine users grabbing the figures and selling them for a small profit.\n\n\n\nThough PM figures have no set scale, they can be compared in size to 1\/7 or 1\/8 Scale figures. They may be slightly larger or smaller than those scaled figures but usually are somewhere around that size. This, of course, does not mean that they are properly scaled. It's simply a size comparison one can use when deciding if PM figures are worth it.\n\n\n\nPros\n\nCost. If you just have to have a scale figure but aren't willing to dish out the serious cash for one, prize machine figures are a good alternative. They're the size of a scale without the cost of one. \n\n\nInteresting. VOCALOID prize machine figures often come as interesting variants to the popular Crypton characters (though there are also many Lily PM figures as well). The most recent batch of prize machine figures from SEGA includes three Miku figures and a Rin figure based on costumes from the Project Diva Arcade game as well as a special Christmas version of Miku in Project Diva style.\n\nRealistic. Just like figmas and scaled figures, prize machine figures follow human proportions rather well. There are allowances made for the anime-styled look but these figures allow fans to have characters seemingly come to life in their home.\n\nEasy to Obtain. Despite what many may think, prize machine figures are very easy to come by if you know where to look. Places like Mandarake and AmiAmi sell them very frequently. Even years after the figures are no longer in machines, one can often find the figure(s) they're looking for on one of the two mentioned websites. It just takes a bit of dedication to watch the sites and be able to grab the figures.\n\n\n\nMiddle\n\nQuality. The quality of figures varies from series to series and manufacturer to manufacturer. As time has gone on, older prize figures like the EX series have been replaced with much higher quality figures. But if you're looking for a certain character, you may not be able to find a figure of them in high quality. \n\n\nCharacter Selection. Prize machine figures do offer opportunities to collect figures of characters that don't get much attention. Though Miku dominates the market, Lily is actually close behind. So despite there being a lack of characters, there are still many figures of characters that don't get the scale figure treatment very often.\n\nThe Stands. Stands also vary by series and manufacturer. Some look very nice while others detract from the overall appearance of the figure. Bases usually won't be so much of a turn off as to keep people from wanting to buy the figures but they may be considered a bit of an eye sore at times.\n\nThe Faces. Though this can also be considered as quality, faces seem to be the one thing that stick out the most when something is wrong with a figure. Everything else can look incredible but there seems to be quite a few prize machine figures that have faces that look off. Whether the paint job is odd or the proportions used are just off, sometimes the faces can be a deal breaker, but not all the time. Sometimes they're absolutely beautiful.\n\n\n\nCons\n\nLikely to Deform. Prize machine figures are made to be cheaper than their expensive scale figure counterparts. This leads to the use of cheaper materials. Even scaled figures will eventually experience sagging parts as the plastic warms and heavier, less supported parts are given the chance to move. Cheaper materials have a higher chance of eventually sagging.\n\nSupports. Though supports can be considered as part of the base, they can also be considered as their own category. The bases themselves can look nice but the supports can make a prize machine figure look absolutely horrible. This is especially noticeable when it comes to Miku as her long, wide twin tails often require quite a bit of extra support.\n\nThese supports are almost always made of clear plastic but just as the case is with Nendoroid and figma bases, the clear plastic is still visible. This often detracts from the overall appearance of the figure.\n\nBut without supports, there would be sagging and breaking. And that would be even worse.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPrize Figures\n\n\n\nNot to be mistaken with prize machine figures, prize figures are usually won from convenience store lotteries. In the case of VOCALOID figures, the lotteries can give Nendoroids, figmas, or scaled figures as prizes.\n\nThe cost of the figures depends mainly on the rarity and popularity of it. If the figure was a common prize, it'll usually run around $40-$60 USD. If it's one of the \"Last Prizes\", mentioned previously in the Nendoroid section, it'll go for quite a bit more.\n\nThe cost of prize figures also goes up as time goes on and fewer are available for sale. \"Last Prize\" figures from previous years can already be seen going for several hundred dollars on some websites while finding them on others is near impossible.\n\nThese figures are limited to stores in Japan (for VOCALOID figures, usually Family Mart) so obtaining them outside of Japan can be a challenge.\n\n\n\nFor this section, the pros, cons, and middle ground will all be specific to the prize figures of VOCALOIDs, specifically the Happy Kuji: Hatsune Miku events as they are the most frequent way to get prize figures. All of the figures for the Happy Kuji: Hatsune Miku events are made by Good Smile Company. As such, they are all of very high quality. Not all prize figures are made by GSC and, as such, this portion of the guide should only be used for those interested in collecting the VOCALOID themed prize figures from the Happy Kuji: Hatsune Miku events.\n\nIn addition, the pros and cons will focus mainly on quality and ease of obtaining the figures due to the range of figure types available in the lotteries. For specific pros and cons of each figure type, check the corresponding parts of this article.\n\n\n\nPros\n\nQuality. As stated before, all prize figures for the Happy Kuji: Hatsune Miku events are made by Good Smile Company. As a result, the quality of the figures is always fantastic. \n\n\nAs of this article. the scaled figures available as prizes are of very high quality. They are NOT prize machine figures but actual scaled figures.\n\nUnique. The Happy Kuji: Hatsune Miku figures are often very interesting. Figures include Nendoroid Petites of the Miku, Rin, and Len Append, a Nendoroid Miku dressed as Santa, and even a Nendoroid and figma Miku in a Sailor Uniform ready to go to school.\n\nMiddle\n\nScale Figures are Reskins. Though the Nendoroids and figma are brand new, fans may recognize Lat-Type Miku: Autumn Ver.'s pose from the original Lat-Type Miku scale figure. Both of the scaled figures offered so far from the Happy Kuji lotteries are alternative color schemes of existing figures. \n\n\n\n\nCons\n\nSomewhat Difficult to Obtain. Depending on which prize figure you want, it can be moderately to incredibly difficult to obtain it. Prize figures aren't as abundant as prize machine figures and the \"Last Prize\" figures are extremely hard to come by.\n\nLack of Characters. Due to the Happy Kuji events being Crypton based, only the Crypton characters will ever be featured in these events. As of the time this article was written, most of the figures are of Miku. One Rin and one Len Nendoroid have been made. Smaller prizes do feature other Crypton characters but the Nendoroids, figmas, and scale figures seem to be mainly Miku based.\n\nVaried Prices. Everything from popularity, rarity, and age of the figure makes it difficult to put an exact price tag on the figures. Some go for cheaper than regular Nendoroids or scaled figures while some Nendoroids can only be bought for hundreds of dollars.\n\n\n\nScaled Figures\n\n\n\nIf you're looking for high quality, well proportioned, and detailed renditions of your favorite VOCALOID characters, scale figures are by far the best place to turn. Prices vary greatly depending on the scale and amount of detail but an average price is about $100 USD with the most expensive figures not reaching over $300 USD and usually not even hitting the $200 USD mark.\n\nSmaller figures, of course, cost less while larger ones cost quite a bit more. You can usually get a 1\/8 scale for around ¥9,000 to ¥10,000 while a 1\/7 is usually at least ¥10,000 and can get closer to or even over the ¥15,000 mark.\n\nThe most popular sizes for scaled figures are 1\/7 and 1\/8. However, figures as small as 1\/12 (and 1\/10) and as large as 1\/4 have been made. These scales are harder to come by though, and VOCALOID figure collectors will likely have more 1\/7 and 1\/8 scaled figures than any other size.\n\nThese scaled figures are based on the size of the character so height varies. However, most 1\/7 and 1\/8 scaled figures are around 200mm (7.9 inches) to 300mm (11.8 inches) tall.\n\n\n\nOver the years, there have been scaled figures of many VOCALOID characters. Some are harder to get than others with Good Smile Company figures being the easiest to obtain and most abundant. However, other companies have made spectacular figures as well.\n\n\n\nPros\n\nQuality. Out of all the options, scaled figures are by far the highest quality option on the market. These figures almost always have incredible craftsmanship with the smallest pieces sculpted and painted to perfection. The higher up you go in price, the more detailed the figure.\n\nHowever, there are reports of some manufacturers providing low quality figures. Be sure to look into unfamiliar names for examples and reviews of their previous figures.\n\nLifelike. Following the quality comes the fact that these figures are scaled models of characters. They follow proportions well and that added to the quality makes these figures almost like the character has entered your home.\n\nThe Stands. With Prize Machine figures, it's likely that making sure the figure doesn't become deformed comes before making sure that the stand looks nice. With scaled figures, the two usually go hand in hand. Companies try their hardest to provide a supported figure that won't break while also looking like a work of art and not something held up by clear plastic.\n\nEasy to Obtain. Most scaled figures can be pre-ordered from multiple sources. If the item is a Good Smile Company product, you can pre-order it from their online shop. If it isn't a GSC product, there are various sources to go through assuming the company making the item doesn't have their own website.\n\nAnd should you miss the pre-order period for whatever reason, most figures will eventually show up for sale used somewhere. Mandarake and AmiAmi both sell used figures.\n\n\n\nMiddle\n\nPrice. The number one turn off for most fans is the price tag on scaled figures. The nicest ones will easily put a dent in the wallet of an average person. However, the price is far from a con. You pay for what you get. \n\n\nIt may be something that turns people away but it isn't something that should. The prices are actually rather cheap when compared to other products. Just compare the 1\/4 Scaled Hatsune Miku (¥25,741) with the Steiff x Hatsune Miku bear (¥36,111).\n\nOccasional Issues. Sometimes, there isn't enough support for a figure or something is more flimsy than originally thought. Racing Miku 2011 ver. is infamous among the avid collectors for its tendency to break.\n\nHowever, this is a rarity. Usually the figures hold up well so long as you are gentle with them. The largest problem most people have is parts of the figure eventually leaning or sagging. This issue can be fixed by a few days in the plastic blister pack the figure came in.\n\nSize. 1\/7 and 1\/8 Scaled figures are rather large, most clocking in slightly over 200mm. Though some, like the Deep Sea Girl are shorter but have quite a bit of width to them.\n\nFragile. Scaled figures are very fragile compared to more flexible figures. While Nendos can usually survive a fall with a small scuff and figmas are also rather durable, scaled figures are more likely to take quite a bit of damage. While this isn't a problem if the figures are displayed somewhere safe, keeping them somewhere that they can fall is dangerous.\n\n\n\nCons\n\nRemovable Parts. If a scaled figure has parts that aren't connected to the figure, it's sometimes difficult to put them in the proper place and possibly hard to keep them there as well. Even the smallest movement can lead to the piece coming out of place. \n\n\nSmall Parts. Coupled with the fragile nature of scaled figures, small parts suddenly become very easy to accidentally remove even when they're not supposed to be removable. In other words, there's a chance that these small pieces will break off. Once again, it's very important that you take care of your figures. Though all figures can suffer from damage after a fall, scaled figures tend to take falls the worst.\n\nCleaning. Probably the most frustrating part of scaled figures is also the most enchanting: the incredible attention to detail. Though this brings the figures to life and makes them works of art, it also leads to many small nooks and crannies that dust can get into. If you don't have the right tools, it can be difficult to properly clean the figures. However, it's not difficult to obtain the proper tools. (Though it's still a bit difficult to dust all the nooks and crannies of some of the more complicated figures.) A soft makeup or paint brush works great as a duster for all types of figures. Make sure not to buy an extremely cheap one, though. You want to make sure that the bristles won't fall out in the areas you're trying to clean.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\n\n\nIf you're interested in VOCALOID figure collecting, you have a lot to choose from. You can go with the pose-able Nendoroids if you find the deformed chibi look appealing or choose figmas if you'd like pose-ability but prefer a more realistic scale. If you want a realistic looking figure and don't care if you can't move their limbs, you can choose from prize machine or scaled figures depending on your price range.\n\nShould you be interested in something more casual and inexpensive, Nendoroid Petites and Nendoroid Plus figures are both options.\n\nAnd if you're into collecting slightly rarer items, prize figures are right up your alley.\n\nThere's so much to choose from but that means that everyone can find something that works for them. Buying figures is a great way to not only support your favorite VOCALOIDs but also to display your love of them.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nStay tuned for the next article in the VOCALOID Figure Collecting series: Bootleg Figures","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/StartingCollectingFeature-1.jpg","width":2229,"height":832}}</script>
