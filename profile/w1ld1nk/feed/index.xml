<p>In these days full of news, even <a href="https://www.taito.co.jp/">TAITO</a> gives us something to look forward to! The famous video game and arcade systems company just announced a new version of one of its most successful hits, <strong>GROOVE COASTER WAIWAI PARTY!!!!</strong>. This time, the game features VOCALOIDs and even Virtual YouTubers! Let&#8217;s check it out!</p>



<h3>A new Rhythm Game with Your Favourite Vocalists! </h3>



<p>The newest installment in the GROOVE COASTER series, which is also available on Android, iOS and Windows devices, this time lands on <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong>. GROOVE COASTER WAIWAI PARTY!!!! features not only J-Pop music like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX_ViT4Ra7k">Lemon </a>by Kenshi Yonezu, but also lots of VOCALOID music and even some Vtubers&#8217; most famous songs.</p>



<p>The game is set to be released in <strong>November 2019</strong> as a digital only title costing <strong>6,500 JPY</strong> before tax. GROOVE COASTER WAIWAI PARTY!!! will come with a vast library of tracks to play, ranging from not only the above mentioned music, but also anime songs and even <a href="https://www.google.it/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=14&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwijgdW_r63kAhUPy6QKHfFEC7AQFjANegQIBBAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.touhouwiki.net%2Fwiki%2FTouhou_Wiki&amp;usg=AOvVaw1U2lzwwY2FIDCaRAGMomak">Touhou</a> music soundtracks, reaching a track list with more than <strong>100 songs</strong> to choose from. Having so much choice will surely give you a hard time picking a song! </p>



<p>GROOVE COASTER WAIWAI PARTY!!!! will be playable both with touch screen controls and buttons, or even while holding your Joycons in a more &#8220;Active&#8221; mode, as suggested in the trailer of the game. Up to <strong>four people</strong> will be able to play in local mode.</p>



<h3>Theme Song</h3>

<p>This year&#8217;s <strong>Hatsune Miku: Magical Mirai 2019</strong> brought us so many, exciting news for us fans to enjoy! Besides the newest updates on Piapro Studio and the status of the Character Vocal Series&#8217; family, C<a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/25">rypton Future Media</a> announced a new service already online: <a href="https://kiite.jp/">Kiite</a>! </p>



<h3>What is Kiite?</h3>



<p>Kiite (which also means &#8220;Listen&#8221;) is a new streaming service released today (31th August) by Crypton Future Media, the company famous not only for being <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/1">Hatsune Miku</a> and her friends&#8217; creator, but also for other community-based services, such as the world&#8217;s largest VOCALOID music label <a href="https://karent.jp/">KARENT</a>, <a href="https://sonicwire.com/">SONICWIRE</a>, <a href="http://piapro.jp/">Piapro </a>and <a href="https://sonoca.net/index_en.html">SONOCA </a>to name a few. </p>



<p>This time, Crypton presented, during an intense conference held at the Magical Mirai 2019, Kiite, a new music playing and streaming service, completely free! Kiite works through playlists, which users can make by themselves or already pick from pre-existing ones. Rest assured that your favourite VOCALOID song is on that site! And if not, you can simply ask for it to be added through the Request tab!  <br>The service is currently available only in Japanese, but don&#8217;t worry: it&#8217;s easy and intuitive to use even for people who can&#8217;t read Japanese at all! Follow the guide on how to register your account down below! </p>



<h3>How to Register! </h3>



<p>Making an account on Kiite is quite easy! </p>



<p>Step 1: Go on <a href="https://kiite.jp/">kiite.jp</a></p>



<p>Step 2: on top right, just below an empty profile icon, there are two buttons, ログイン (Login) and 新規会員登録 (Signup). Click on this second one! (If your device doesn&#8217;t display correctly Japanese character, follow the picture down below). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="76" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-1024x76.png" alt="" class="wp-image-242069" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-1024x76.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-300x22.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-800x59.png 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Click on the second tab, the one after ログイン！</figcaption></figure>



<p>Step 3: You will be shown a form: the first line is for your desired URL. <em>Please note that this one can&#8217;t be changed, so choose wisely!<strong> </strong></em>It must be between 4 and 24 characters, both Japanese and English characters allowed, same for dashes, asterisks and so on. <br>The second space is for your Nickname. This one can be changed! It&#8217;s up to 32 characters, and will be displayed on top of your page.</p>



<p>The third and fourth space are for the mail you use to register, while the other two spaces are for the password. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="795" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-1-795x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-242083" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-1-795x1024.png 795w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-1-233x300.png 233w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-1-800x1030.png 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-1.png 994w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" /></figure>



<p> Once you&#8217;re done filling the form, click on the button at the end. You will be asked to check your datas, confirm them. Then, you&#8217;ll be asked to check your mail to confirm your account. <em>Please note that the link they&#8217;ll send you lasts up to 12 hours. Also, don&#8217;t forget to check your spam, if you don&#8217;t see the mail!</em></p>



<p>And you&#8217;re done! Your account is now ready!</p>



<h3>But How Does it Work?</h3>



<p>On Kiite, you can search your favourite music in different ways: you can search for the name, the singer or the producer (on the site, called Creator). In this example, I searched for <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/51">ささくれ.uk</a>. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="326" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-2-1024x326.png" alt="" class="wp-image-242097" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-2-1024x326.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-2-300x96.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-2-800x255.png 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-2.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Here&#8217;s the search menu</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the keyword (キーワード) you can search for the song, the playlist or the creator. The options underneath are for searching all contents with those words, original songs (オリジナルのみ) or covers of that song/artist (カバーのみ).</p>



<p>Playlists are quite intuitive, too! If you like a song, you can add it to your personal playlist and give it a like, as well. Playlists can be shared, too. <a href="https://kiite.jp/creator/v0QQpKcw6K">This </a>is a sample of the playlists for <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/51">sasakure.UK</a>. </p>



<p>But what if the song you were searching for isn&#8217;t there? That&#8217;s easy! On the main page of Kiite, you&#8217;ll find a Request form. You just have to add the URL of a video, either from NicoNicoDouga or Youtube, and you&#8217;re done! The song will be added as soon as possible! </p>

<p>Kiite is definitely something really nice you can enjoy during your everyday life! Please give it a try, and share with us your favorite songs!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For VOCALOID 4 users, it&#8217;s always nice to try out new voicebanks, even if it&#8217;s just for a limited time, there are various VOCALOIDs that can be used for a trial period. Starting today, even <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/30995">Xin Hua&#8217;s V4 Japanese</a> is available as a free trial on Gynoid&#8217;s website!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-129143 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/XinHua_Japanese_Design.png" alt="" width="484" height="706" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/XinHua_Japanese_Design.png 484w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/XinHua_Japanese_Design-206x300.png 206w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px" /></p>
<h3>About the trial version</h3>
<p>We already talked about the V4 update, and we focused especially on Xin Hua&#8217;s new Japanese voicebank that will be released on September 22nd, 2017. While waiting for the VOCALOID&#8217;s release, the company decided to allow fans to download the trial!</p>
<p>The trial will be available for 14 days and will be given out with a folder containing extra wav files (breath files), along with two different Xin Hua Japanese voicebanks: Xin Hua Natural and Xin Hua Power. Just as any other VOCALOID4, the voicebanks are compatible with the <em>Growl </em>feature and can be used together thanks to the <em>Cross-Synthesis </em>function included in the V4 Editor.</p>
<p>To download the trial click <a href="http://gynoid.co.jp/news/view/54/">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>If during the process, the installer asks you for the activation key of the product, just click &#8220;No&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Keep in mind that you&#8217;ll need a VOCALOID4 Editor in order to use this trial. If you unfortunately don&#8217;t own a copy of the Editor, don&#8217;t worry: There&#8217;s a free trial version of the software available for download on YAMAHA&#8217;s website once you finish setting up an account. You can find the trial <a href="https://net.vocaloid.com/products/trial/2">here</a> after logging in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The official <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yamaha.vocaloid" target="_blank">VOCALOID Facebook page</a> as well as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CCrusherP/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Crusher-P</a> have just announced a new V4 VOCALOID: &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/53367" target="_blank">CYBER SONGMAN</a>&#8220;. As one may be able to guess, he&#8217;s in the same series as the female V4 vocal, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/31020" target="_blank">CYBER DIVA</a>.</p>
<h3>Voice Bank Information</h3>
<p>Recommended Range: A1 to A3<br />
Recommended Tempo: 70 to 190 BPM</p>
<h5>Extra Features</h5>
<p>CYBER SONGMAN has a second User Dictionary. One can switch between the two in order to have a more British or American accent.</p>
<p>In addition, he has two extra phonemes: [4] and [@l].</p>
<p>[4] is the American English tap-t sound. It&#8217;s used in words like &#8220;better&#8221; where there&#8217;s not quite the sound of a T nor a D.</p>
<p>[@l] is a syllabic [l] sound (that&#8217;s lower-case L). It&#8217;s used in words like &#8220;apple&#8221;.</p>
