										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately, we&#8217;ve been delighted by the amount of good news about video game and VOCALOID collaborations. We&#8217;re excited to announce that a new collaboration between Hatsune Miku and another Japanese game is starting soon! Our beloved digital diva will be part of a game world that is definitely fit for her; we&#8217;re talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PriPara">PriPara</a>!</p>
<h3>What is PriPara?</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-129065" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Pripara_logo.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="353" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Pripara_logo.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Pripara_logo-300x212.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>PriPara is an arcade rhythm game developed by Syn Sophia and published by Takara Tomy, where the player can create their own character and show off during lives, just like a real idol!  Following the popular &#8220;Pretty Rhythm&#8221; trend, of which you can find references to in the game itself, PriPara is not only available as an arcade game, but was also as 3DS games. It was even given two anime adaptions by Tatsunoko and DongWoo A&amp;E, &#8220;PriPara&#8221; and the sequel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idol_Time_PriPara">&#8220;Idol Time PriPara&#8221;</a>.</p>
<h3>About the Game</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, PriPara is mostly an arcade rhythm game that can be played on arcade machines mainly in Japan, but also in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The player will be able to create their character (or, to be more specific, their in-game Idol) and play lives in any of the different game modes available. Each game mode has unique game play, songs, coords (similar to modules in the Project Diva games), and prices.</p>
<p>In most of them, the live performance is divided into two rhythm sections: one for the members&#8217; appeal, a runaway section (not available in Dream Theater mode), a &#8220;Making Drama&#8221; and a &#8220;Cyalume Change&#8221; (special outfit chane). Names may be different in each mode. Before the live performance, the player will be able to choose the coordinated clothes (coord) to wear through PriTickets, Millefeui coords or QR codes in the 3DS versions of the game. At the end of the live, based on the mode chosen, the player can obtain a prize (usually coords) depending on which game mode was played. Then, the arcade machine provides a PriTicket to the player. It can be printed and then be used to reload their Idol and a coord for the next time.</p>
<p>The top part of the PriTicket can be torn off to exchange it with friends that will be able to use it to load your character during team plays.</p>
<h3>Collaboration with Hatsune Miku</h3>
<p>The collaboration between Miku and the game will start on October 5, 2017 with the &#8220;Time 4&#8221; major update, and more content will be released afterwards.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-129036" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/DHf74IZUIAA3oQT.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="449" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/DHf74IZUIAA3oQT.jpg 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/DHf74IZUIAA3oQT-300x135.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Starting from October, Hatsune Miku&#8217;s coords and the theme song &#8220;Go!Go! PriPara Life&#8221;, sung by Miku herself, will be released in the game.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-129049" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/DHf82WdUQAAHkV1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="580" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/DHf82WdUQAAHkV1.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/DHf82WdUQAAHkV1-300x218.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Hatsune Miku&#8217;s coord can be equipped on any character, both main and custom ones in the game. Falulu, popular in the PriPara universe for being a &#8220;Vocal Doll&#8221; (an exclusive PriPara universe Idol, made to grant humans&#8217; wishes to became idols), will have a special edition for this costume off of her, with a different color palette reflecting her own usual colours. This version of the coord will be available in November.</p>
<p>Finally, Miku will be available as a playable character in December! We&#8217;re going to be able to see her debut in this universe, where everyone can be an Idol!</p>
<p>Remember to stay tuned to VNN for further news on this collaboration and more!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Last month, we had quite a bit of news about mobile games. Most of which brought us new exciting collaborations and features to play with. Unfortunately, we can&#8217;t always expect good news: a few days ago, VOCADOL&#8217;s team announced the shutdown of their game. VOCADOL was released in December, 2015 and, come August 26th, it&#8217;ll shut down.</p>
<h2>About VOCADOL</h2>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t hear about this game before, VOCADOL was described as an &#8220;Idol Training&#8221; and a &#8220;Mystery Adventure&#8221; game. Surprisingly enough, this VOCALOID game is more a RPG card game where various VOCALOIDs act as the main characters. The featured VOCALOIDs are: <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/2113"><strong>Merli</strong></a>,<a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/156"><strong> Aoki Lapis</strong></a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16545"><strong>Kokone</strong></a>,<a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/139"><strong> Lily</strong></a>,<strong> MIZKI (<a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/117">VY1</a>)</strong>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/381"><strong>CUL</strong></a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/18365"><strong>Anon</strong></a>, and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/18364"><strong>Kanon</strong></a>.</p>
<h3>Opening theme</h3>
<p>VOCADOL also has an opening theme sung by the eight VOCALOIDs in the game. Called &#8220;Kokoro Charge Music&#8221;, it was composed by Ashin Kureda. You can listen to it below on Soundcloud and YouTube!</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F236726257&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=618&#038;maxheight=927"></iframe></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RjcQeRPc65Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h4>Gameplay</h4>
<p>The game features a complete plot and each character has a precise biography. Different from what you could expect from the &#8220;Idol training&#8221; description, VOCADOL is not a rhythm game but an RPG based on cards and collectable weapons. You can equip the weapons on cards with some characteristics, like elements.</p>

<p>Cards can represent the eight main protagonists, or even original characters from the game and can be used to increase levels on the main cards. The VOCADOL cards had to gain experience to level up through other cards, and even having two twin cards, could increase their power, changing slightly the illustrations on the card itself!</p>
<p>With the update to the version 2.0 of the game, the game was revamped. Game play, interface and more were completely changed, also adding new features like gachas and automated card training during a certain amount of time.</p>

<h3>Server&#8217;s Shutdown</h3>
<p>The official Twitter account for the game gave the announcement of the server&#8217;s shutdown in two weeks: August 26, 2017. The tweet also gave a huge thank you to all the players that supported the game.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="ja" dir="ltr">いつもVOCADOLをご利用いただきありがとうございます。このたび、VOCADOLは2017年8月26日をもちましてサービスを終了させていただきます。今までのご愛顧ありがとうございました。</p>
<p>&mdash; VOCADOL (@vocadol) <a href="https://twitter.com/vocadol/status/895099321321873408">August 9, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re playing VOCADOL, or if you did in the past, and you still want to play it, or see your collection one last time, you&#8217;ll be able to do so until the 26th of this month. So bid a last goodbye to your favorite heroines.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that the game has a website and can be still downloaded from the store until the shutdown day! You can use the links below to find them!</p>
