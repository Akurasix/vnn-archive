										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you thought that the VOCALOIDs singing in other languages discussion was over, you are mistaken. While voice banks have designated languages, that hasn&#8217;t stopped people from making them sing beyond those. Some are successful, while others could use a little more work. Either way, it&#8217;s quite interesting when you hear VOCALOIDs singing outside the box.</p>
<p>In the meantime, let&#8217;s explore the languages that have been sung by these virtual vocalists. For this editorial, it won&#8217;t be limited to the foreign ones, which means that every voice bank that has sung beyond their designated language is fair game.</p>
<h3>Polish</h3>
<p>On December 13, 2013, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/1" target="_blank">Hatsune Miku</a> was used by producer <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/44952">daniwell</a> to sing a Polish folklore cover of <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/44952">To i hola</a></em>. daniwell created the cover to be used by the Polish National Museum of Ethnography.</p>
<p><iframe width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IoSzz-zr2eA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This would not be the last time Miku would sing in Polish, as she was used again by a different producer, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/9279">Marvyanka</a>, to sing <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/70603"><em>Zanim Zniknę</em> </a>or <em>Before I Vanish</em>. Marvyanka used <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/75" target="_blank">Miku Append</a> for this song, which ended up being much darker of a theme compared to Miku&#8217;s first Polish song. Though it wasn&#8217;t used for a museum, it was still accompanied by a MMD video, which is available for public viewing.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9nv2EoUIqg4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3>Swedish</h3>
<p>Believe it or not, VOCALOID has been used to sing in Swedish. And no, it&#8217;s not <em>Caramelldansen</em> (as awesome as that would have been). It might come as a surprise, but Clara was used to sing the song <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/68740">Utopia</a></em> in Swedish. Producer <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/25449">EmmyKSama</a> had entered this song for the Bruno and Clara Original Song Contest.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/csVKN_rplPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3>Italian</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s continue the experimentation of Clara (and to an extent, Bruno) where they sing for us in Italian. Producer <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/29697">Mi:Elen</a> has used Clara and Bruno to sing the Italian song,<em> <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/76473">Fiume</a></em>. Wait a minute&#8230; hasn&#8217;t this producer also used MAIKA to sing in Italian? Fear not, MAIKA will get her time in the spotlight later in this editorial.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPASJ6DoOOc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tagalog</h3>
<p>The language of Tagalog has been experimented with by producer <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/2755">ensou</a>. The VOCALOID ensou has primarily used for their Tagalog songs is GUMI for <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/49486">Time Traveler</a></em>,  <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/17570">Event Horizon</a></em>,<em> <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/44069">Coma</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/79652">Singularity</a></em>. However, Miku Append has also been used by ensou for the song <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/57173">Entropy</a></em>. KAITO has had his voice lent in this language by producer <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/22861">Kazaki</a> for the song <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/96176">Ngayon</a></em>.</p>

<h3>Romanian</h3>
<p><a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/2331" target="_blank">neutrinoP</a> is a Romanian producer who often creates works in English and/or Japanese. However, he also brings Romanian to the table on rare but amazing occasions.</p>
<p><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/73286" target="_blank">Promisiuni</a> (&#8220;Promise&#8221;) featuring <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/268" target="_blank">GUMI</a> was neutrinoP&#8217;s first song in Romanian.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_lz4TUqcfyQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Since then, he has produced only <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/51457" target="_blank">one other song in Romaian</a>. It originally featured <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16545" target="_blank">kokone</a> but was also covered using <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16933" target="_blank">Tohoku Zunko</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U5BudBhxUMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3><strong>The Case of MAIKA</strong></h3>
<p>MAIKA is a bit of a unique case when it comes to her languages. Officially speaking, she is meant to sing in Spanish. However, her creators had added phenomones to her speech pattern. Because of this, she is capable of singing in Catalan, Italian, and Brazilian Portuguese.</p>
<p>In her Catalan category, producer <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/622">Giuseppe</a> used her for the song <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/41607">Fantasia</a></em>, a song from the musical <em>El Regne de la Fantasia</em>.  Another producer, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/25200">Nil Prosciutto</a>, used two different versions of MAIKA: one for Spanish and one for Catalan. These two MAIKAs were used for the song <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/67950">Te l&#8217;imagines</a></em>, which is only available for viewing to those who have the link and comments have been disabled. What&#8217;s interesting about the video is that it displays a different art direction, with the art resembling more of a children&#8217;s drawing.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bJFFA7X_fHs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOY5G4zUZAw&#038;feature=youtu.be</p>
<p>In the area of Brazilian Portuguese, there are currently no original songs sung by her as all of her songs in that language are covers of other songs. Her most notable usage is by producer <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/17176">MattplusBC</a> who has had her cover <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/50247">Xibom Bombom</a></em> and <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/91093">Temporal</a></em>.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DhyNAAbdBkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>And last but not least, when it comes to the Italian language, Mi:Elen used MAIKA to sing the original song <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/76471">Porta Magica</a></em>.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3XvP_8lE-4</p>
<h3>Are There More?</h3>
<p>Well, sure there are more; some are even covers of already existing VOCALOID songs. But the thing that both producers and manufacturers of foreign voice banks need to realize is that they have to make sure these pronunciations and dialects are functional and understandable to the target audience. This can be tricky, especially if the voice bank was never meant to sing in a particular language to begin with. Does that stop producers from trying? Of course not! This is VOCALOID, a program that has been capable of making an impact on many people from around the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>VOCALOID has been capable of giving people the chance to make their own songs and use voice banks represented by virtual idols to sing those songs. One of the things that’s very impressive is that these voice banks can sing in a number of languages. For the most part, we’re aware that VOCALOIDs can sing in Japanese, as well as English. But the software isn&#8217;t limited to just those two languages. From Spanish to Chinese, there are VOCALOIDs that are designed to sing in languages that are beyond what we are typically used to hear from them. For this editorial, the focus will be on the ones that sing in languages that aren’t just Japanese or English. Let’s take a trip to the VOCALOIDs of other languages.</p>
<h3>Korean</h3>
<figure id="attachment_1133" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1133" style="width: 598px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SeeU-2-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1133 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SeeU-598x1024-1.png" alt="" width="598" height="1024" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1133" class="wp-caption-text">SeeU&#8217;s Official Art</figcaption></figure>
<p>Let’s turn our attention to the first language sung by a VOCALOID that wasn’t solely Japanese and/or English. The VOCALOID 1 and VOCALOID 2 softwares both were limited to their voice banks singing in either of the two aforementioned languages. It wasn’t until VOCALOID 3 where that began to change. <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/193" target="_blank">SeeU</a> (released in October 2011), was the first VOCALOID to sing in a language besides Japanese or English: Korean. However, she is also capable of singing in Japanese.</p>
<p>A few of her Korean language songs include <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/8461" target="_blank"><em>Shining</em> <em>Star</em></a>, <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/8449" target="_blank">RUN</a></em>, and <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/8463" target="_blank"><em>Umbrella</em></a> (not to be confused with the Rihanna song). At this time, SeeU is the only VOCALOID with a Korean voice bank.</p>
<p>There is a new virtual singer that has been announced to also sing in Korean. Her name is <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/28174" target="_blank">UNI</a> and she was originally announced in November 2014 with <a href="https://rayduxz.cl/vocaloid/2015/08/04/vocaloid-uni-illustration-revealed/" target="_blank">an updated announcement</a> in August 2015 and expected release date of sometime in 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Spanish</h3>
<figure id="attachment_1153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1153" style="width: 1001px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrunoClara-1-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1153 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrunoClara-1-1001x1024-1.jpg" alt="" width="1001" height="1024" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1153" class="wp-caption-text">Bruna and Clara&#8217;s Boxart</figcaption></figure>
<p>The next new language to be introduced to the program was Spanish. The first duo to sing in Spanish were <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/384" target="_blank">Bruno</a> and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/385" target="_blank">Clara</a>. There was a bit of controversy with these two, not so much because of their singing, but more because of their design. Regardless, their release was still in 2011.</p>
<p>Their songs are typically sung together or Clara singing with <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/13431" target="_blank">MAIKA</a>, the third Spanish singing VOCALOID.</p>
<p>However, they still have some songs that they sing on their own. Clara’s songs include <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/68687" target="_blank"><em>A Banshee Named 42</em></a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/66226" target="_blank"><em>Más que Nada</em></a>, and <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/66235" target="_blank">Un día de Amistad</a></em>.</p>
<p>A few of Bruno’s solo songs are <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/9351" target="_blank">El manisero</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr04KyG5BWE" target="_blank">La Flaka</a></em>, and <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/9354" target="_blank"><em>El Makoki</em></a>.</p>
<p>You can hear Bruno and Clara singing together in<em> <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/68783" target="_blank">Blanco &amp; Negro</a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/68683" target="_blank">Electronegative</a>, </em>and<em> <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/67989" target="_blank">Ballroom Breakdown</a></em>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xAjReUIycZY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<figure id="attachment_1154" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1154" style="width: 1001px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MAIKA-1-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1154 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MAIKA-1-1001x1024-1.jpg" alt="" width="1001" height="1024" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1154" class="wp-caption-text">MAIKA&#8217;s Box Art</figcaption></figure>
<p>The next VOCALOID to sing in Spanish was MAIKA. She was released in December of 2013, two years after Bruno and Clara were made available. It should also be noted that MAIKA is also capable of singing in Catalan as heard in <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/41607" target="_blank">Fantasia</a></em>, along with Brazilian Portuguese (<em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/98768" target="_blank">Garota de Ipanema</a></em>) and Italian (<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/98769" target="_blank"><em>Una Notte a Napoli</em></a>) thanks to extra phonemes added to her voice bank. These are languages that have yet to be sung by any other VOCALOID.</p>
<p>Back on to MAIKA’s Spanish songs, a couple of examples would be <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/40572" target="_blank">En tu Mirar</a></em> and<em> <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/44227" target="_blank">Ni Una Sola Palabra</a></em>. Beyond these three VOCALOIDs, there are no other Spanish voice banks to talk about and there are currently no announcements on the development of another Spanish voice bank.</p>

<h3>Chinese</h3>

<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/LTianyi-1.jpg'><img width="171" height="300" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/LTianyi-1-171x300.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/LTianyi-1-171x300.jpg 171w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/LTianyi-1.jpg 507w" sizes="(max-width: 171px) 100vw, 171px" /></a>
<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/YANHE-1.jpg'><img width="105" height="300" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/YANHE-1-105x300.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/YANHE-1-105x300.jpg 105w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/YANHE-1.jpg 327w" sizes="(max-width: 105px) 100vw, 105px" /></a>

<p>Continuing the languages of VOCALOID 3, there is <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/1778" target="_blank">Luo Tianyi</a> (on the left), a female voice capable of singing in Mandarin Chinese. Her initial release was in July 2012. A few of her songs in Mandarin include <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/13721" target="_blank"><em>March Rain</em></a>, <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/13723" target="_blank"><em>Millennium Recipe Song</em></a>, and <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/13722" target="_blank">Natural Story</a></em>.</p>
<p>Following in her footsteps, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/10025" target="_blank">YANHE</a> (on the right) came next as the second female Mandarin Chinese voice bank. She was released one year after Tianyi in July 2013 and her songs include <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/32614" target="_blank">Rain of Dreams</a></em> and <em>Stage 1</em>.</p>

<p>Xin Hua was released this year, 2015, in the month of February but fans knew about her as early as 2014. She&#8217;s the third released female Mandarin Chinese vocal. It&#8217;s worth noting that she was the first Chinese VOCALOID to come from Taiwan. Her songs include <em>Shī</em> and <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/93630" target="_blank"><em>Huá Xīn Cǎi</em></a>.</p>
<p>Also released this year was <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/23972" target="_blank">Yuezheng Ling</a>, the fourth public mandarin Chinese female vocal. She was released during the month of July. There aren’t many songs with her as of now, but you can still listen to her in <a href="http://vocadb.net/S/90012" target="_blank"><em>Scarlet Drop</em></a><em> and </em><a href="http://vocadb.net/S/90963" target="_blank"><em>Mèng Yǔ</em></a>.</p>
<p>There are three Chinese singing VOCALOIDs currently in production: <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/35966" target="_blank">Stardust</a>, <span class="extraInfo"><a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/23974" target="_blank">Zhanyin Lorra</a></span>, and <span class="extraInfo"><a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/39621" target="_blank">Yuezheng Longya</a>,</span> with Longya confirmed to be the first male Chinese vocal after many fans were upset after Stardust (the 6th female Chinese voice bank) was announced. There is also a Chinese prototype of <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/15665" target="_blank">Macne Nana</a> that was set aside for future release.</p>

<p>At the time of this editorial, there aren’t any other languages that have been confirmed that future VOCALOIDs will be able to sing in. Though Macne Nana had the possibility of obtaining a French voice bank, the possibility of it happening has been determined to be limited.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean more languages won’t happen, though. It’ll most likely take some time because it&#8217;s necessary to consider the pronunciations and dialects that need to be incorporated to resemble human speech.</p>
<p>VOCALOID is growing in popularity worldwide with the help of concerts taking place in China, Spain, France, Indonesia, and the United States. Who knows what the next language will be? Maybe one day VOCALOIDs will be capable of singing in all of the major languages of the world.</p>
<p>What languages would you like to hear VOCALOIDs singing in? It can be a new one that has yet to happen or one that you feel doesn’t get used enough.</p>
