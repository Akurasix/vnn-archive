<p>Last but not least, we have the <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/71" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KAITO</a>-themed PC glasses! As expected, they sport KAITO&#8217;s trademark blue color scheme, and the very ends of the temple tips are designed to look like the tips of <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/9805" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KAITO V3</a>&#8216;s scarf. Something that makes KAITO&#8217;s glasses unique, is how they actually sport half-rim frames! Like the others, they will be available for ￥15,012 JPY (about $136 USD) on Washin&#8217;s website sometime in the middle of September, 2017.</p>
<p>Additionally to purchasing the glasses individually, you can also purchase them in a special bundle that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>All 5 of the above PC glasses</li>
<li>5 small glasses cloths, each with a different design by <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/2094" target="_blank" rel="noopener">一斗まる (Ittomaru)</a></li>
<li>1 large glasses cloth with all 5 designs</li>
<li>1 special carrying case with removable interior padding, made by <a href="http://www.armor.co.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARMOR</a></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VoxWave</a> attended Dokomi in Germany! And, of course, it wouldn&#8217;t be a full VoxWave party without <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16693" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Baka Kitsune (TBK)</a>, Co-Founder of VoxWave, Youtaite, and voice provider of <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/51585" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LEORA</a>. The German division of VNN was lucky enough to be able to ask her a few questions about everything she&#8217;s involved in. Here&#8217;s VNN&#8217;s interview with TBK!</p>
<h3>The Interview</h3>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong><em> How are you enjoying Dokomi and Germany so far?</em></p>
<p><strong>TBK:</strong> It&#8217;s really great! I came to Germany for the last time five years ago, so I was really happy to be able to come back here. It&#8217;s a great time and opportunity to practice my German, too!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN:</strong><em> Is there anything you personally want to say to your fans?</em></p>
<p><strong>TBK:</strong> Keep loving virtual singers! This team is awesome, okay? And keep doing what you like in life. Everything is good, everything is great!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>Regarding your recent work on LEORA, how was recording for you?</em></p>
<p><strong>TBK:</strong> I already did record an UTAU before, my UTAU <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16694" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guren Nataku</a>, so I was kinda used to the process. But it was also different with LEORA because we wanted it to be really precise and <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16843" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drak-pa</a> kept telling me to re-record samples because we needed to have the phoneme sounds to be really precise and specific. So it was a bit longer. We took like an entire weekend to record the French and I still have to record the English, which will be the hardest part, but I really enjoyed it!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty surprised because LEORA actually has a beautiful high lyrical voice and really beautiful high notes, and I just have recorded a medium voice range, so I&#8217;m kinda confused. I have no idea where they come from, but it&#8217;s cool because it&#8217;s kinda complimentary? I can&#8217;t sing high notes very well and she can sing them for me, which is really cool.</p>

<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/leora.png'><img width="712" height="475" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/leora.png" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/leora.png 712w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/leora-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px" /></a>

<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>What was your first reaction when you heard LEORA for the first time?<br />
</em><br />
<strong>TBK:</strong> Joffrey told me, &#8220;Oh, I can hear your voice in LEORA,&#8221; and I was like, &#8220;Oh, really?&#8221; because I&#8217;m so used to my raw natural voice during the recording process, so it feels completely different for me to hear it through a voice synthesizer. I really don&#8217;t see LEORA as a copy of my voice, really not! I think it&#8217;s a new being, a new entity. It&#8217;s really interesting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>How would you describe the relationship between LEORA and ALYS?<br />
</em><br />
<strong>TBK:</strong> We made LEORA as kind of an &#8220;Alter/Ego,&#8221; if I can say it like that, of <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/16811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ALYS</a> so that she can be everything you want her to be! Some people see them as lovers, others as best friends or even enemies. I personally see it as they&#8217;re from the same world, so they&#8217;re just here together. I like all of the things that they can do together?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>And how would you describe YOUR personal relationship with LEORA?<br />
</em><br />
<strong>TBK:</strong> Uhm, that&#8217;s a hard one. I see her like she is a part of me. She&#8217;s everything I can&#8217;t do in public. I like to see her as a warrior, as a berserker, and a strong woman! Sometimes I&#8217;m angry and I can&#8217;t really publicly say, &#8220;I want to destroy it!&#8221; But I feel like LEORA has this attitude where she would say it. I like her; she is my girl, my fighting girl. She&#8217;s our girl with VoxWave and everyone&#8217;s girl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>If you could say something to LEORA in person, what would that be?</em></p>
<p><strong>TBK:</strong> Never give up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>Would you like to perform some day with her side by side?</em></p>
<p><strong>TBK:</strong> Yes, definitely! To be honest, I already asked Joffrey to do a duet song with LEORA because I really think it would be great and, as I said, she has beautiful high notes. So I think I can do the low parts and she can take over the high parts. I really want to try it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VNN: </strong><em>What do you wish for LEORA in the future?</em></p>
<p><strong>TBK:</strong> I hope that people will welcome her just like they did with ALYS. She isn&#8217;t here to replace ALYS; she&#8217;s here to help her! She&#8217;s here to bring forth a new part of their universe. So I really hope people will enjoy LEORA and make songs with her. I just want her to bring something to people.</p>

<h3>Who is CircusP?</h3>
<p>Circus is a producer, well known for his EDM music style. He mainly utilizes western VOCALOIDs and produces a large selection of songs. Some of these have appeared in VOCALOID Rankings while others were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJfL_GNREWk&amp;list=PLPnvD5D791RJOW3I_oMab7egz8c_AymO0">official demos</a> for new voice banks.

<h3>The Interview with CircusP</h3>
<p><strong>dotkrawl:</strong> <em>Okay, so first of all, I would like to thank you for your time and the opportunity for the </em><em>interview. I&#8217;m pretty sure there are a lot of people out there who want to know more about you personally</em><em> and your soon-to-be-released album, &#8220;715!&#8221; But let&#8217;s start this a little less specific: How </em><em>did you get into VOCALOID?</em></p>
<p><strong>Circus:</strong> I&#8217;m happy to be here! But, oh wow, that question honestly has a somewhat embarrassing answer&#8230; I got into VOCALOID around mid to late 2008. I was really into <em>The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</em> and the ending theme to that series became a huge animation trend. One day, I stumbled upon this video of the dance using this 3D model of a girl with long blue pigtails. I wondered, &#8220;Who&#8217;s that? She sounds awful, but she&#8217;s cute!&#8221; LOL. After that, I looked her up and found out that she was a VOCALOID! And then it just kinda spiraled from there!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dotkrawl:</strong> <em>I feel like that may be how many fans have found Miku and VOCALOID in general. </em><em>But did you know or find out what a VOCALOID was that moment or did that take longer? I mean, </em><em>a lot of people even today believe VOCALOID is an anime or a game.</em></p>
<p><strong>Circus:</strong> Well, even as a kid, I knew that research was the key to get into something&#8230; while I might not have immediately gotten into VOCALOID right then and there, when I got more curious, I used my trusty friend Google and found out pretty easily! I didn&#8217;t know about English VOCALOIDs yet, but I was around for Luka&#8217;s release. I remember being super excited to hear a VOCALOID sing in English! So, there might have been a time when I thought it was an anime. But that didn&#8217;t last very long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dotkrawl: </strong><em>Bless Google, honestly. Was that excitement for Luka&#8217;s release and the fact there was an English VOCALOID your inspiration to start writing music? Or did that happen completely unrelated to VOCALOID?</em></p>
<p><strong>Circus:</strong> That actually didn&#8217;t happen until 2010, which was around a year after Luka&#8217;s release&#8230; overseas producers were in the very early stages then, but I was inspired by a few UTAU producers who were making original songs! Specifically, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/4895" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yesi-chan</a> really influenced me to try out making my own music. The fact that there was an English VOCALOID to use did help, though&#8230; if Luka didn&#8217;t exist, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have started writing songs in English at all!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dotkrawl:</strong><em> Imagine Luka never existed. Would you have used Miku for songs or would you have tried other things? Like singing yourself or just producing instrumental tracks?</em></p>
<p><strong>Circus:</strong> Hmm&#8230; I&#8217;d probably use Rin or Miki to write songs in Japanese! They&#8217;d be very, very bad, though. It wasn&#8217;t until recently that I started to focus on learning more Japanese. So my songs would have been utter nonsense! Haha!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dotkrawl: </strong><em>Indeed, but it probably still would&#8217;ve had some charm. Haha. Now let&#8217;s move on to the present, shall we? When you start writing for an album, do you have any theme you try to apply to it? Is there any set inspiration or do you just go with the flow?</em></p>
<p><strong>Circus:</strong> I suppose I just go with the flow, at least with my past releases. Something that I like to do is post songs as I write them, and then compile them into an album after I have a suitable amount of songs! This way, it&#8217;s like people are with me along the ride of writing an album. Each album documents my growth as an artist within a time period. I&#8217;m planning on trying new things in the future with releases, though! But, for now, that&#8217;s still very early in the works. Haha.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dotkrawl: </strong><em>It&#8217;s probably better that way. Otherwise, you would have to set your creativity to </em><em>some kind of a limit by choosing a theme. For your new release, &#8220;715,&#8221; what stage of your growth as </em><em>an artist does it display? Or what do you think, if someone were to ask what emotion this album was </em><em>mostly driven by, would be the answer?</em></p>
<p><strong>Circus:</strong> Oh wow, hmm&#8230; <em>715</em> is a pretty emotional album, much more so than my first album, <em><a href="http://vocadb.net/Al/1818" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lucid</a></em>. Up until &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/69187" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goodbye</a>,&#8221; I was writing songs without much emotion put into them. It was more like trying to tell a story that wasn&#8217;t exactly mine. But, starting with &#8220;Goodbye&#8221; and the songs following that one, I really focused on writing my emotions and my experiences! So, I suppose &#8220;715&#8221; is the first release of mine where each song is very much a fragment of myself. I suppose, a common theme of the album is resentment and heartbreak. However, as you progress through the tracks, they start to have an underlying hopeful sound to them. I guess a good way to describe it would be, &#8220;I&#8217;m not okay now, but I will be soon!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dotkrawl:</strong> <em>So, since you&#8217;ve departed from that &#8220;old kind of writing,&#8221; you&#8217;ve tried many new things both on </em><em>the album itself, as well as on the road towards it. Do you feel that you&#8217;ve accomplished your goal to put </em><em>your emotions into the songs or do you think there&#8217;s room to improve?</em></p>
<p><strong>Circus:</strong> I think that I&#8217;ve definitely become more attached to my music with my newer songs. I feel more connected and a bit more protective of them, honestly! There is always room for improvement, though. I never like to think that I&#8217;ve reached a stopping point with my music. Emotions are intricate and always progressing! Who I am two years ago is not who I am now. I suppose it&#8217;s also been really good for my own growth as a person. I&#8217;m able to pinpoint times in my life where I felt a certain way. Lately, it&#8217;s become less of an attempt to write songs to please other people, and it&#8217;s more like a diary entry with each new release.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dotkrawl:</strong> <em>So would you say that all songs are, in some way or another, connected to each other? I mean, you&#8217;ve written series before like with &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/23345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lie</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/15636" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I(愛)</a>,&#8221; and on the album itself there&#8217;s kind of a thing, too, with the tracks &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/122983" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Different Seas</a>&#8221; and &#8220;Castaway&#8221; being sort of sister-songs, but would you consider the whole album as such?</em></p>
<p><strong>Circus:</strong> Well, each song is written with a different emotion and initially is not connected in any way&#8230; however, with each full-length album of mine, I have a character that goes along with it that is meant to represent that time in my life! I suppose that even though each song on <em>715</em> varies from emotion and topic, they do correlate in that, when put together, they create &#8220;Glacier!&#8221; The representative character for <em>715</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/glacier_cover.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-111647 size-medium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/glacier_cover-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/glacier_cover-300x300.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/glacier_cover-150x150.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/glacier_cover-1024x1024.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/glacier_cover.png 1425w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><em>Album cover featuring &#8220;Glacier&#8221; by <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/46713">Sleppu</a></em></p>
<p><strong>dotkrawl:</strong> <em>That&#8217;s interesting to hear and I&#8217;ll come back to that soon! But, for now, let me ask another </em><em>question regarding the songs themselves: Which song do you personally believe to be the most </em><em>important or intense message-wise, and why?</em></p>
<p><strong>Circus:</strong> Oh gosh, that really varies as time goes by&#8230; I honestly think &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/160013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poltergeist</a>&#8221; is one of my best songs created so far. But the meaning is a bit hidden behind metaphors and vague lyrics. Haha. I&#8217;d say that I really like how people relate to &#8220;<a href="http://vocadb.net/S/125064" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Copycat</a>!&#8221; It&#8217;s a song that I wrote about something I end up doing (although, taken a bit to an extreme), and seeing other people relate to this trait as well really made me happy! I like writing songs that can connect with people, and helping people find the words that they&#8217;re feeling in that moment means the world to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dotkrawl:</strong> <em>I assume the people are happy as well for having someone they can relate to in hard times. </em><em>Speaking of that, can you talk a bit about the collaboration song with <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/9940" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nostraightanswer</a>, &#8220;Patches</em><em>?&#8221; It&#8217;s been a while since you did a collaboration with him, so what made you guys sit down </em><em>together and do this?</em></p>
<p><strong>Circus:</strong> We&#8217;ve been planning on doing a collaboration for a while, actually! He&#8217;s a VocaloP that I really look up to, so it&#8217;s been really exciting to be able to work with him on a song. I pitched the idea to him and it was initially going to be a solo song as a sort of vocalist debut for myself! However, with the lyrics that were written, we both ended up relating to them a lot and we decided to turn it into a duet! I think that was the best course of action as it sounds super cool now! I&#8217;m very proud of it! Hopefully, everyone will also really enjoy it as well!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dotkrawl:</strong> <em>I like the song a lot myself, so you guys definitely did a great job on it! Honestly, you can feel </em><em>what parts have been made by you and what parts by Kenji without it interrupting the flow! So may </em><em>I ask about how the workflow felt for you? Isn&#8217;t it sort of limiting your own perspective of the song by </em><em>having someone co-writing it?</em></p>
<p><strong>Circus:</strong> It definitely didn&#8217;t feel limiting at all with &#8220;Patches!&#8221; I&#8217;ve collaborated with a few different producers and &#8220;Patches&#8221; was one of the smoothest in terms of creation. We tossed around the production file back and forth, so it really felt like a song we worked on 50/50! I&#8217;ve tried that before but it&#8217;s normally very hectic and ends up making the song sound like a mess&#8230; so it was really refreshing that &#8220;Patches&#8221; happened so easily! I love collaborating with other producers because from each song I learn so much, and &#8220;Patches&#8221; definitely taught me a lot!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dotkrawl:</strong> <em>That&#8217;s good to hear! While we are already speaking of collaborations, you&#8217;ve also been </em><em>collaborating a lot with the artist <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/46713" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sleppu</a> recently. What&#8217;s the most outstanding part of </em><em>their art in your personal opinion and why do you like it?</em></p>
<p><strong>Circus:</strong> I&#8217;ve been collaborating with Sleppu a lot lately, huh? Haha. I suppose that&#8217;s because I find Slep&#8217;s art a great combination of styles that I really love! His art feels very light and soft, yet he also has the ability to add dark and gritty tones to it. The way that he draws his faces is a style that I really love and his ideas are really great! I contacted him to create the character for this album and his design was exactly what I envisioned! It&#8217;s really rare to find an artist that you are 100% on the same page with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dotkrawl:</strong> <em>I fully agree on the last part. So coming back to this, do you want to tell us anything about &#8220;Glacier?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>Circus:</strong> Hmm&#8230; well, Glacier is a character that I feel represents how I&#8217;d want to present my music at the moment! I&#8217;m very into the icy arctic theme at the moment, so Glacier is designed with that in mind. I feel like this also relates to my music, as the songs kind of have a cool and distant feeling in them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dotkrawl:</strong> <em>Does that mean that you&#8217;re going to have another character with your future releases depending on how you progress as a person?</em></p>
<p><strong>Circus:</strong> For full-length albums, that&#8217;s a trend I would like to continue, yes! However, this doesn&#8217;t mean that every release of mine may follow this&#8230; I suppose the best way to put it is that I&#8217;d like this presentation to be continued for albums similar to <em>Lucid</em> and <em>715</em>, ones that are more so compilations of specific time periods in my life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dotkrawl:</strong> <em>Thank you very much for your time, then! Just one last question: Is there anything you want </em><em>to say to the readers and your fans?</em></p>
<p><strong>Circus:</strong> Thank you for the interview. It was a lot of fun to do! Also, I&#8217;d like to thank everyone for supporting me! VOCALOID is what I love and it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m very fortunate to be able to do. However, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to continue to release songs and albums without your support. I hope to continue to improve in my works and bring you better and better albums in the future! At the moment, I feel like <em>715</em> is a compilation of my best works yet, and I hope you all look forward to it! Thank you again!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/192">AHS</a> now has quite a reputation for creating successful VOCALOID concerts in <a href="/concerts-a-figure-and-other-yuzuki-yukari-merchandise-announced/">Japan; Berlin, Germany;</a> and Vienna, Austria! This year, AHS will return to Berlin, however, the concert will feature only VOCALOIDs. Yuzuki Yukari&#8217;s voice provider, <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/53358">Chihiro Ishiguro</a>, won&#8217;t be at the show. The news was met with some displeasure from both the fans and Chihiro herself.</p>
<p>This is the reason why Michael Klement of Anime Kultur Verein <em>(German for &#8220;Anime Culture Society&#8221;),</em> who also organized Anime Messe Berlin, has started a Kickstarter campaign to get both Chihiro Ishiguro and the musician <a href="http://vocadb.net/Ar/323">EHAMIC</a> at the show. EHAMIC has produced multiple songs for Chihiro to be on site at this year&#8217;s convention. The convention is being held from June 23rd to the 25th at the <a href="https://www.animemesse.de/#location">KOSMOS</a> in Berlin, Germany.</p>
<h3>What is the Anime Kultur Verein?</h3>
<p>The Anime Kultur Verein was founded in 2014 by 20 anime and manga fans/friends in Berlin, and has been trying ever since to bring more of the anime, manga, and Japanese Pop culture to Germany. Last year, they organized the first VOCALOID concert in Germany featuring AHS on the huge stage at Anime Messe Berlin.</p>
<p>Since last year the concert was held on Friday and not all fans were able to attend, this year they managed to have the concert on Saturday of the convention (June 24th). This way, more people may be able to attend.</p>
<p>In collaboration with AHS, they were able to confirm the concert for the convention as well as acquire the equipment needed. The problem is that Chihiro Ishiguro would like to perform along with her VOCALOID on stage, together with the live music by EHAMIC.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3f1qX6ozMr8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>A link to the Kickstarter can be found <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1826512733/chihiro-ishiguro-and-ehamic-konzert-auf-der-anime/">here</a> as well as at the end of the article.</p>
<p>The goal of the Kickstarter is to enable Anime Messe Berlin to pay for the travel cost and accommodation expenses (which is €4000 EUR) for both guests. In addition to that, they would like to be able to perform at the concert on Saturday. They also hope to have their own concert on Sunday. Please note that AHS is not directly involved in the Kickstarter and this is being done entirely by Anime Kultur Verein.</p>
