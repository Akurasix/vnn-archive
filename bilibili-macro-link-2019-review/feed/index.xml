					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/bilibili-macro-link-2019-review/#comment-31&quot;&gt;anonie&lt;/a&gt;.

The text of the article I was responding to didn&#039;t say anything about &#039;official&#039; or anything else. I was responding to what was written. As written, it&#039;s incorrect. Also, not sure what exactly makes the chokaigi concerts &#039;unofficial&#039; to begin with besides use of MMD. It seems as official as this one.]]></description>

I&#039;d say that it&#039;s more correct in this case because these aree official models and not MMD, fan made performances. I&#039;m sure Choukaigi has licences and permission etc etc, but they&#039;re not inherently official.
Nor are the y with two mainline girls from two of the biggest audiences for vocaloid globally]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Overall I think the show had more ups than downs, but I definitely skipped around a lot when watching it. The MikuxTianyi parts were great. Hearing Tianyi sing in Japanese really shows off how cute her voice is (since I can understand Japanese and Chinese just sounds like a collection of harsh sounds to me). 

However, &quot;This iconic moment marks the first time two VOCALOIDs from different companies appearing on stage and singing together&quot; is technically incorrect. That&#039;d be the nico chokaigi shows (pretty much the nicodou equivalent for this show). It&#039;s still really cool though!]]></description>
