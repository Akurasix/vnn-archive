										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On January 11th, Miku Expo Europe kicked off in London! Read on for my review of the event, including details of the concert itself, the Let&#8217;s Paint workshop, merchandise and interviews with other Vocaloid producers and fans I met there. I have also shared some advice for fans who are thinking of attending Miku Expo, or similar events, in future. Enjoy!</p>
<h2>Initial Impressions</h2>
<p>This year I had the pleasure of returning to Miku Expo Europe, held in the O2 Academy in Brixton, London.</p>
<figure id="attachment_250141" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-250141" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_112529-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-250141 size-medium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_112529-300x225.jpg" alt="Miku Expo Europe O2 Academy Venue" width="300" height="225" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_112529-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_112529-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_112529-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_112529-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_112529-800x600.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-250141" class="wp-caption-text">The O2 Academy in Brixton, London</figcaption></figure>
<p>Last time I attended Miku Expo in 2018, the fans were queueing from the early hours of the morning, and this time was no exception!</p>
<p>Though the doors were to open much later than last time, at 6:00 PM, the queue had already formed by 8:00 AM!</p>
<p>Again, people were socialising, playing Vocaloid music and handing out free merchandise that they had made themselves and brought along with them to give away to other fans.</p>
<p>The sense of community in the vocal synth fandom was certainly still going strong!</p>

<h2>Merchandise</h2>
<p>Before the concert, Miku Expo merchandise was available to purchase online, from <a href="https://hatsune-miku.backstreetmerch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Back Street Merch</a>, and in store, at <a href="/japan-centre-ichiba-selling-exclusive-miku-expo-europe-merchandise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japan Centre Ichiba</a>.</p>
<p>There was also a temporary pop-up shop at Metro Brixton, that opened from 12:00 PM to 6:00 PM on the day of the concert.</p>

<a href='/miku-expo-europe-2020-london-review/20200111_121832/'><img width="150" height="150" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_121832-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="Miku Expo 2020 Shop Queue" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_121832-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_121832-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>
<a href='/miku-expo-europe-2020-london-review/20200111_133901/'><img width="150" height="150" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_133901-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="Miku Expo 2020 Popup Shop" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_133901-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_133901-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>
<a href='/miku-expo-europe-2020-london-review/20200111_134511/'><img width="150" height="150" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_134511-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="Miku Expo 2020 Pop up Shop Interior" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_134511-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_134511-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The queue for the pop up store was quite long and the shop itself was fairly small so it was a bit chaotic in there but I ended up getting some nice things.</p>
<p>Merchandise was also available inside the venue when the doors opened, both downstairs in front of the entrance to the standing area and upstairs in front of the entrance to the seated circle area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a href='/miku-expo-europe-2020-london-review/20200111_183858/'><img width="150" height="150" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_183858-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="Miku Expo 2020 Merchandise Queue Upper" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_183858-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_183858-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>
<a href='/miku-expo-europe-2020-london-review/20200111_183906/'><img width="150" height="150" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_183906-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="Miku Expo 2020 Merchandise Queue From Above" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_183906-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200111_183906-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>

<p>The shop outside the seated circle area was the quieter of the two, though the demo for Miku Mega39s was also located downstairs next to the merchandise queue, so it was hard to access that.</p>
<p>For those who did make it to the demo, however, there were free stickers and pin badges available. Sadly, I couldn&#8217;t get near enough to try it but my friend kindly grabbed me a pin badge while he was there.</p>

<p>As before, VIP ticket holders were also given a selection of exclusive items as part of their VIP package, which were handed out to them by staff as they entered.</p>

<p>(Just to avoid confusion, the streamers shown to the right of these items in the picture below were not part of the package, they shot out from the stage and into the crowd during the concert.)</p>

<h3>My Setlist Highlights</h3>
<p>I have quite a few highlights this time, so please bear with me! There were so many good song it&#8217;s been hard to cut it down so I&#8217;ve picked 4 to talk about in more detail.</p>
<p>Firstly, I&#8217;ve got to say that I adored seeing Miku Fiesta live. It was so fun and full of energy that I couldn&#8217;t stop moving and the song has been in my head ever since the concert!</p>
<p>I also really loved the performance of Hyper Reality Show by Utsu-P. It was a really intense performance, with some cool stage interactions and effects that made the crowd go wild!</p>
<p>My absolute favourites from the setlist were Rolling Girl by Wowaka and Odds and Ends by Ryo. Both brought me to tears and I nearly lost my voice singing along!</p>
<p>The tribute to Wowaka was so touching&#8230; The sight of glowsticks turning white in unison and then hearing the start of Rolling Girl really hit me hard. It was truly humbling to see how many hearts Wowaka had touched with their music.</p>
<p>And then, when Odds &amp; Ends came on, I knew I was going to get emotional. Odds &amp; Ends has a special place in my heart and I had actually said to others previously that I would love to see it live.</p>
<p>For a moment, I couldn&#8217;t quite believe my dream was coming true and then, as I sang along to the words &#8216;Wakatteru, hontou wa&#8217; (&#8216;I understand you, really&#8217;), I felt my voice shake and my tears flow and I sang with all my heart.</p>
<p>I think those moments will be ones that I shall remember and cherish forever.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s Paint Workshop</h2>
<p>The day after the concert, there was a Miku Let&#8217;s Paint event held at Japan Centre Ichiba.</p>
<p>In 2018, the event involved buying and painting an O-Miku figure but, this time, the event went digital and all the painting was done on smart devices, using an app.</p>
<figure id="attachment_250128" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-250128" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200112_120833-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-250128 size-medium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200112_120833-300x225.jpg" alt="Miku Expo Let's Paint Photograph" width="300" height="225" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200112_120833-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200112_120833-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200112_120833-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200112_120833-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200112_120833-800x600.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-250128" class="wp-caption-text">My fiance painting his own Miku using the app!</figcaption></figure>
<p>To start painting, attendees had to first scan a QR code using their smart phone or tablet device. This would then take them to the application, which allowed you to &#8216;paint&#8217; directly onto a 3D model of Miku, using the provided Miku Expo stylus, for better precision.</p>

<a href='/miku-expo-europe-2020-london-review/20200112_120741/'><img width="150" height="150" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200112_120741-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="Miku Expo 2020 Stylus" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200112_120741-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20200112_120741-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The app allowed you to pick a colour, change the size of the brush, zoom in and out, rotate and move around the model.</p>
<p>Once you were happy with your design, you could then enter &#8216;Studio Mode&#8217; to add a background to your Miku. This also added the effect of lighting and a shadow on your model.</p>
<p>For the background, you could select an image from your phone.</p>
<p>I tried to make a &#8216;me&#8217; Miku and chose a picture I had taken the previous evening, outside the concert venue.</p>
<p>I actually lost my progress when trying to save but I managed to start over later on. It&#8217;s not the best design I saw by far, but I&#8217;m much happier with the end result!</p>

<p>When you had completed your Miku, the staff encouraged you to share your creation on social media using the hashtag #MyMiku and, if you showed them your finished Miku, they gave you a sticker and let you choose one other free item from a selection of keyrings, wristbands, acrylic stands and more! I picked out a lovely 5th Anniversary Rin and Len acrylic stand.</p>

<h2>Interviews</h2>
<p>During the weekend, I got the chance to meet up with many fans, artists, cosplayers and producers. I couldn&#8217;t possibly interview them all but I managed to sit down with a group of producers and fans to ask them a few questions about their experience and their thoughts on the future of vocal synthesisers. Please note that these interviews were conducted before the concert and the Let&#8217;s Paint workshop. I have marked my questions with Q and their answers with A, so it&#8217;s clear who&#8217;s talking in each interview.</p>

<p>Q: So, can you please state your name or alias?</p>
<p>A: My online alias is QuasarP.</p>
<p>Q: Can you tell me how long that you&#8217;ve been into Vocaloid, if you know?</p>
<p>A: Well, I guess it depends when I got<em> really</em> interested in Vocaloid. So I&#8217;ve been really interested since around 3 years ago when I started making my first songs up until now. But before that, I was introduced to Vocaloid through my music teacher, in high school. At that time, it seemed interesting and I checked out a few of the earlier songs but I wasn&#8217;t inspired enough to create my own music. It was only recently when I wanted to create my own music that I got back into it and just discovered far more facets of it that were a lot more interesting to me.</p>
<p>Q: You&#8217;ve kind of answered one of my next questions around whether you do any creative work so, with the creative work you do, how many songs do you think you&#8217;ve done in your career so far?</p>
<p>A: I think it&#8217;s a bit over 20 or 30&#8230; but then a lot of it is also remixes so I don&#8217;t know if those count&#8230; When I do remixes, I take the vocal tracks from another producer friend of mine and then change the instrumental to another sensation or mood that I think will be interesting for the vocals of the song so that&#8217;s the non-original work I do besides original songs.</p>
<p>Q: So, do you do artwork as well? Do you do art to go with your Vocaloid (music) work?</p>
<p>A: Yeah, I create my own illustrations for my songs but sometimes I just want to mix things up a bit and maybe commission another artist, just to achieve a certain mood or sensation that I couldn&#8217;t otherwise by myself.</p>
<p>Q: Okay, cool. So have you been to Miku Expo before?</p>
<p>A: I have been to 2 Miku Expos. I have been to the 2018 one in London and the 2019 one in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Q: That&#8217;s interesting, I haven&#8217;t actually met anyone who&#8217;s been to the Hong Kong one as well. Could you tell me, is there a big difference between the Hong Kong version and the Europe version, anything in particular that stands out as different to you?</p>
<p>A: Well, the main difference I guess is just the stage. That really is the only thing I can think of like, here, it&#8217;s mostly standing, or at least I think it is, for this one but, in Hong Kong, there are seats and stuff. But I know this isn&#8217;t the case for Germany, which my friend told me about, where there are seats so I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s pretty similar, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Q: So, we haven&#8217;t got into the concert yet but, so far, is this what you expected of the experience and are you looking forward to it?</p>
<p>A: Yeah, I&#8217;m looking forward to it. I&#8217;m quite excited too. You know, the first time I came here for the first Miku Expo (Europe) event, there wasn&#8217;t as many friends that I could hang out with but, this year, with me there are like four friends sitting next to me now so, like, it&#8217;s a lot more exciting this time because there&#8217;s more of a connection with real life interaction, in terms of my hobby work.</p>
<p>Q: That&#8217;s really cool. I really like how Vocaloid brings everybody together, like, there&#8217;s definitely a sense of community around everyone so that&#8217;s really important to me. So, I guess, we&#8217;ve talked a little bit about the concert itself but are you perhaps going to try out the Mega 39s demo, the Switch game, if you can?</p>
<p>A: I guess it depends if I feel like it or not but, currently, I don&#8217;t have a plan for what I&#8217;m going to do for the rest of the night, you know.</p>
<p>Q: And the Miku Paint event, do you think ?</p>
<p>A:  I guess that will depend on these friends I&#8217;m sitting next to, like, do they want to go to the event or not.</p>
<p>Q: I guess we&#8217;ll find out then! Going off topic a tiny bit, have you heard the Miku New Type demos yet?</p>
<p>A: Oh, I saw the video! I only watched like 15 seconds of it but it&#8217;s cool that they&#8217;re having a new engine, new voicebank, and I&#8217;m looking forward to trying it out. I really wish they would have an English version for Miku, like on the engine soon, as that would be most useful to me.</p>
<p>Q: Same, to be honest, yeah. I guess we&#8217;ll see how it goes. What do you think will happen to Vocaloid now, going forward?</p>
<p>A: I think it&#8217;s good to have more software in the vocal synth space because, when there&#8217;s only one incumbent software over the course of a few years, there&#8217;s nothing stopping them from doing things that may not be the best idea and, when there&#8217;s more competition and software,  I think it will create more change and more improvement in the technology. That&#8217;s just my opinion, I guess.</p>
<p>Q: I think that&#8217;s fair.</p>
<p>A: But I haven&#8217;t tried that many other software besides Vocaloid so I&#8217;ve got to hop on that as well!</p>
<p>Q: Fair enough, yeah. I use Vocaloid and Cevio at the moment but I think it&#8217;s going to be exciting to see how this branches out and what happens next for Vocaloid. Anyway, I think that&#8217;s all I was going to ask so thank you for your time!</p>
<p>A: Thank you.</p>

<p>Q: So, can you please state your name or alias?</p>
<p>A: My alias and producer name is Makushi Frequency or Makushi-P.</p>
<p>Q: So, do you how long you&#8217;ve been into Vocaloid?</p>
<p>A: Well, I&#8217;ve been into Vocaloid since 2016 and I actually got into it because I got myself a PlayStation Portable. I tried a lot of games that were on the system and one of the games was Hatsune Miku Project Diva. When I tried that, at first, it was kind of just a meme, like getting into Vocaloid and the concert stuff and people cheering at what was just a projection and then the meme got real and I started liking&#8230; I started loving the songs as I played through Project Diva. The first song I really got into Love is War and, since 2016, it has been evolving more and more over time.</p>
<p>Q: So, do you actually do music yourself in Vocaloid as well?</p>
<p>A: Yes, I do, since 2016, about half a year after I got into the Vocaloid community I started producing music and I got better at producing music. I did it when I was like 8/9 years old at first but stopped doing it in 2011 when I was 11 year old and got back to it through Vocaloid basically. First I started using Magix Music Maker and basically used the program as far as I could but you can&#8217;t do much with it, you can use VST instruments with it and such but it&#8217;s complicated to work with, I did my best. Over time, I switched over to FL Studio but I&#8217;ve been producing music ever since even though I haven&#8217;t done as much music in 2019 as before because my personal life has been a little bit more complicated.</p>
<p>Q: That&#8217;s fair enough. Same, to be honest! So, is this the first time you&#8217;ve been to Miku Expo?</p>
<p>A: No, it&#8217;s not actually my first time. I&#8217;ve been to the Miku Expo Cologne in Germany. It was a really cool experience but I had to stay but I had to stay in Cologne till about 2 AM for my train and then I had to stay up in school the whole next day so it was kind of complicated but yeah. It was really cool going there.</p>
<p>Q: So, still worth it, you think?</p>
<p>A: Yeah, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here!</p>
<p>Q: Of course. So, are you interested in trying to Mega 39s demo, the Switch game?</p>
<p>A: I certainly am. As soon as I heard the announcement, I got myself a Switch, and basically I&#8217;m waiting for that game as it&#8217;s the game I&#8217;m most interested in right now. I think it will come out later in 2020. I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to that. I didn&#8217;t play it yet.</p>
<p>Q: I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;s going to be inside the venue. I&#8217;d like to have a go on it myself. Are you thinking about going to the Miku Paint event tomorrow?</p>
<p>A: I&#8217;m here in London with a friend and I don&#8217;t want to leave him alone all the time so we&#8217;re going somewhere else tomorrow so we&#8217;re not going to the Miku Paint event. Also, I can&#8217;t draw so I don&#8217;t know if I could really relate much.</p>
<p>Q: That&#8217;s okay! It&#8217;s not for everyone. So, I guess, going off topic from Miku Expo now but I just wondered, have you heard the Miku New Type demos?</p>
<p>A: Yes, I did hear them but, while I think it&#8217;s cool that they switched the engine and are turning Hatsune Miku from a Vocaloid into another voice synthesizer program, it didn&#8217;t sound all that different from the Miku we know and love so&#8230;</p>
<p>Q: Yeah, I kind of agree, I&#8217;ll be honest. It does seem similar but I guess everyone would complain if it was different so it&#8217;s one of those things where it hasn&#8217;t &#8220;Wow&#8217;ed&#8221; me yet but I don&#8217;t know what to expect. I&#8217;m kind of hoping there&#8217;ll be an English bank or something at some point.</p>
<p>A: We&#8217;ll see what producers produce with it. I suppose the new program comes with new capabilities, new things you can try and that will definitely lead to more interesting songs to be produced.</p>
<p>Q: So, what do you think is going to happen to Vocaloid itself, when New Type comes in?</p>
<p>A: I think diversity is good and a lot of products on the market are always good because it creates competition and competition usually brings more exciting and better products on the market so the future will be bright.</p>
<p>Q: Cool. It&#8217;s good to be positive about it, really hopeful. Well, I think that&#8217;s all I really needed to ask so thank you very much.</p>

<p>Q: So, can you please state your name or alias?</p>
<p>A: Hello, I&#8217;m Shey.</p>
<p>Q: Do you know how long you&#8217;ve been into Vocaloid?</p>
<p>A: I&#8217;ve been into Vocaloid since 2012. The first song I ever heard was from Miku, &#8220;Tell Your World&#8221;. The first time I was like wow, it&#8217;s really good and then I continued listening to more songs and I can&#8217;t of dreamed of becoming a producer, but I didn&#8217;t become a producer until 3 years ago.</p>
<p>Q: So, is that original songs? Or is it like remixes?</p>
<p>A: Yeah, I make original songs. I tried doing a cover but I didn&#8217;t release it, so original works and collabs with other artists, and soon I&#8217;ll be releasing remixes as well.</p>
<p>Q: Cool, so is it just the music side of things you do creatively? Do you do art or cosplay or anything like that as well?</p>
<p>A: Yeah, just music. I hope that I can do some other stuff but it&#8217;s just that. Music is for me.</p>
<p>Q: That&#8217;s fair, that&#8217;s fair. So, is this your first Miku Expo?</p>
<p>A: This is my second Miku Expo. The first one was Miku Expo HK (Hong Kong) last year.</p>
<p>Q: Cool, cool. We haven&#8217;t gone into the concert yet so we can&#8217;t talk about the concert itself but are you excited to play the Mega 39s demo or are you maybe looking forward to the Miku Paint event?</p>
<p>A: I will definitely try it though I have less time because of work. I&#8217;ll definitely be getting the game because I&#8217;m also a fan of rhythm games.</p>
<p>Q: So do you think you might go along to Miku Paint. There&#8217;s an event in Ichiba so I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;d be interested in that?</p>
<p>A: I&#8217;m interest, however, I&#8217;m afraid I cannot go because of schedules.</p>
<p>Q: Ah, okay. Fair enough. So, generally now, have you heard the Miku New Type demos?</p>
<p>A: I&#8217;m afraid not.</p>
<p>Q: Oh okay. There&#8217;s recently been some demos of the new Miku software so I&#8217;m interested to see where that goes. I guess, without knowing what the demo sounds like, what do you think will happen with Miku and the Cryptonloids when they move engine, like what do you think will happen to Vocaloid?</p>
<p>A: I believe Vocaloid will never die and, even though that will happen, I believe Vocaloids are slowly going mainstream and me, as a fan myself, will continue being a fan.</p>
<p>Q: So, you&#8217;re hopeful for the future.</p>
<p>A: Yeah.</p>
<p>Q: Thank you. Well, I think I&#8217;ve covered everything so thank you for your time.</p>

<h3>Rei</h3>
<p>Q: So, can you please state your name or alias?</p>
<p>A: My name is Rei!</p>
<p>Q: Hello Rei! So, if you can remember, how long have you been into Vocaloid?</p>
<p>A: I first found it in like 2015. No&#8230; that&#8217;s a lie. I first found it much earlier than that but I didn&#8217;t know what it was but then I rediscovered it in 2015 and that&#8217;s when I first got into it, I would say.</p>
<p>Q: So, you&#8217;d heard of it but you didn&#8217;t really become a fan until 2015?</p>
<p>A: Yeah, it was memes! Yeah, that&#8217;s how I found it.</p>
<p>Q: I get that, I get that. So do you do any creative work with Vocaloid, do you do art, cosplay, music, yourself?</p>
<p>A: Kind of&#8230; You see, I try to produce but I&#8217;m bad at it so it doesn&#8217;t really work but I sing so that&#8217;s like my main thing to do with it but it&#8217;s not like a mainstream thing, it&#8217;s like a hobby. I don&#8217;t really do it that much but yeah, that&#8217;s what I do.</p>
<p>Q: Yeah, that&#8217;s fine. Hobbies are good! So is that like singing generally or is that singing covers?</p>
<p>A: Covers, yeah. I try to right my own songs but no&#8230; it doesn&#8217;t work. I&#8217;m bad at it.</p>
<p>Q: Aww, keep trying, keep trying! So, is this your first Miku Expo?</p>
<p>A: It&#8217;s my first one.</p>
<p>Q: Oh okay, so are you really excited?</p>
<p>A: Yeah! Kind of nervous but yeah, mainly excited but it&#8217;s going to be good. It&#8217;s going to be good. I&#8217;ve watched them before on YouTube so I know what it is but yeah.</p>
<p>Q: So you know what to expect?</p>
<p>A: Yeah, exactly. So, it should be fine.</p>
<p>Q: Cool. So, we haven&#8217;t gone into the concert yet so are you perhaps interested in trying out the Miku 39s demo, the Switch game?</p>
<p>A: Definitely! Yeah, I have a lot of Switch games so, as soon as I realised that that was going to be released I was like, &#8216;Yes! I&#8217;m going to download it!&#8217; So yeah, definitely. 100%.</p>
<p>Q: So, do you play a lot of rhythm games?</p>
<p>A: Not really, I&#8217;m kind of part of that fandom but only from watching other people do it so I&#8217;ve never played one myself, which is why I&#8217;m so excited, because I&#8217;ve never had the medium to play it before. But because I have a Switch I was like &#8216;Oh my god! I can finally do it!&#8217; So yeah, I&#8217;m going to get it.</p>
<p>Q: Cool, so this will be the first foray into it? Nice, nice. So, there&#8217;s also that Miku Paint event tomorrow. Are you interested in going to that?</p>
<p>A: Probably not, to be honest. I didn&#8217;t really know about it till today so probably not.</p>
<p>Q: That&#8217;s fair, I just wondered. So, I guess, another general Miku/Vocaloid question, have you heard the Miku New Type demos at all?</p>
<p>A: No, I don&#8217;t do Vocaloid software so I don&#8217;t know anything about it.</p>
<p>Q: It doesn&#8217;t matter. If you&#8217;re not into the software then I guess it&#8217;s not something you&#8217;re interested in. So, just generally then, ignoring the software, ignoring the music production, what do you think the future of Vocaloid is?</p>
<p>A: It&#8217;s definitely going to grow. Definitely. I mean, they just announced that Hatsune Miku is going to perform at Coachella this year so that, I think, is going to be a very big stepping stone to Vocaloid in general becoming a very mainstream thing. Especially here, because in Japan it&#8217;s very mainstream, but here (the UK) and other places where they don&#8217;t know it as much I think it&#8217;s going to be very, very mainstream which makes me very, very happy because I can be a weeb and just.. yeah, it&#8217;s going to be good. *laughs*</p>
<p>Q: Yeah, really positive about the future for Vocaloid. Well, thank you very much, I think that&#8217;s everything I wanted to ask but thank you for your time.</p>
<p>A: It&#8217;s okay.</p>

<h2>My Advice to Future Expo Attendees</h2>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t been to Miku Expo before and are considering going to it or similar events in the future, here are a few tips I would like to share with you, based on my own experience and feedback I have heard from other Expo Attendees.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can&#8217;t stand for long periods of time, consider booking a seated ticket at the venue and/or take a lightweight collapsible chair with you so you can take a break while waiting in the long queues. Please bear in mind that you may not be able to sit or take a chair with you into the venue so inquire ahead to be sure of the facilities!</li>
<li>If you want to get a good view of the stage and feel closest to the action, I would personally recommend getting standing tickets. I know this somewhat contradicts my previous point but, if you are able to stand, I definitely think it&#8217;s worth the aching feet! I got seated tickets this time but had standing last time and I would say that my view and my experience were much more intimate last time, where sitting felt somewhat removed and awkward. In standing, you&#8217;re also in the best spot to grab the streamers that shoot out from the stage!  You can really feel the energy when you&#8217;re in the standing area but, if you&#8217;d prefer a more relaxed viewing, then perhaps this isn&#8217;t for you!</li>
<li>Whether you choose standing or seating, wear comfortable shoes so you&#8217;re ready for the queues and make sure you are prepared for the weather with suitable amounts of layers. I know many fans like to cosplay to the event, so this may not be easy for everyone, but remember to take care of yourself as you will want to be comfortable enough to enjoy it!</li>
<li>If you plan to bring a glowstick with you or buy one at the venue, make sure you get ones which are concert-approved and don&#8217;t forget batteries as well!</li>
<li>If you want to get merchandise, I highly recommend ordering what you can online to avoid the queues on the day and the chance of items selling out! Things sell out FAST!</li>
<li>If you do want to buy merchandise at the venue, make sure you take some cash just in case. Though the shops often take card, things can go wrong. I can&#8217;t stress this one enough, as I actually almost missed out on merch at the venue this time when the card machines broke down. You never know what might happen so better safe than sorry!</li>
</ul>
<h2>My Final Impressions</h2>
<p>I heard some great music and met amazing people at Miku Expo Europe 2020 and, though things didn&#8217;t go as smoothly as in 2018, I had a lovely time.</p>
<p>I highly recommend going to a future Miku Expo if you can make it. You&#8217;re guaranteed to have an unforgettable experience!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past weekend, I was one of the many VOCALOID fans to attend Anime Weekend Atlanta. At long last, <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/2347">1st Place</a> debuts ARIA; a story of life, love and peace.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t be sharing too much information on the contents for those that want to experience it themselves without prior knowledge. There was a wonderful story that continued from beginning to end, with lots of unexpected <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/504">IA</a> and <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/31062">ONE</a> lore sprinkled in.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very clear how much 1st Place cares for IA, ONE and their fans. The concert was fantastic from a visual, story and musical standpoints. Several new songs were created for the concert and I would highly recommend checking out the <a href="https://vocadb.net/Al/27093">soundtrack</a> when possible.</p>
<p>Another highlight was certainly the live dancers. There were some very complicated moves they pulled off that made the crowd go absolutely wild. The choreography was amazing and the dancers were spot on. The costumes were just as good; in particular, I loved the complexity of the first one.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>(Some people got to take pictures with IA, depending on what ticket they purchased. What a beautiful outfit!)</p>
<p>Outside the concert was a booth full of IA and ONE merchandise. I may or may not have spent at least $80 there, but it was totally worth it. At the booth was also an AR poster, where you could take a picture of IA and ONE!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you, Anime Weekend Atlanta!!</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Please continue to support 1st Place and other companies, and request concerts like this or VOCAMERICA to come to a local convention near you! I look forward to seeing where ARIA and IA go next.</p>

<p>If you are used to follow us you might already know about <strong>LanCee</strong>, a new Taiwanese Virtual Youtuber produced and managed by the well-known team <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/27057">Voicemith</a>, which also brought to life the well known UTAU <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/27056">Xia Yu Yao</a> back in 2014.</p>



<p>LanCee made her singing debut on June 13th, 2019, with the <a href="/lancees-first-official-music-video-cosmos-dreams-is-now-live/">original song &#8220;Cosmos Dream&#8221;</a>, featuring English and Chinese lyrics. Her channel features a variety of content from EDM tutorials, ringtones, news, and even educational videos.<br><br>On July 30th, she covered the song &#8220;On My Way&#8221; by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Walker_(music_producer)">Alan Walker</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Carpenter">Sabrina Carpenter</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farruko">Farruko</a>. PUBG mobile&#8217;s first-anniversary event featured the original track as the theme song. </p>



<h2>Review</h2>

<iframe loading="lazy" title="Alan Walker, Sabrina Carpenter &amp; Farruko - On My Way Covered by LanCee ft. 葉宗鑫【蘭希LanCee】" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M7k1YmhnNYc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>LanCee and her team rearranged the song as a mellow acoustic track. Vocals are crisp and clear both in tone and in pronunciation. The Spanish verse in the song showcases LanCee&#8217;s skillful rap capabilities. From the original moombahton genre to a more stripped-down vibe of the guitar brings a fresh breath to an already excellent track. </p>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t listened to this marvelous cover, we definitely invite you to do so!</p>

<h2>Review</h2>



<h4>1. Prelude to Dusk (Intro)</h4>



<p>You are welcomed to SYNTECH+ with Lupin&#8217;s thoughts on what these songs are about to him. The poem, though calming, asks us in this moment of calm if we have ever done enough and if it &#8220;Will ever be enough?&#8221;. The piano foreshadows the upcoming track, and then we notice the evening colored horizon drawing near.</p>



<h4>2.  <strong>Someday You&#8217;ll Notice The Evening Colored Horizon</strong> </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Someday You&#039;ll Notice The Evening Colored Horizon (feat. Hatsune Miku)" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8DdavFz_y4w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>High and uplifting synthesizers allures you to &#8220;Someday You&#8217;ll Notice The Evening Colored Horizon&#8221;. The beats and sparkles of the instruments mix together forming a serene yet bright ambiance accompanied by Miku&#8217;s charming voice. Complemented by the lyrics, the song becomes a sincerely heartfelt letter to the Vocaloid community. </p>



<h4>3. Define Me</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="[VOCALOID Original PV] Define Me [MAIKA Original Contest Winner]" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/czHGGKr1aCQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>A track with a strong sense of rhythm and syncopation. &#8220;Define Me&#8221; energetically sings about requesting someone to break you free of the walls you put up for protection yet closing you in isolation. Nostraightanswer&#8217;s use of Maika&#8217;s mature vocals puts forth the song&#8217;s desire to be free.</p>



<h4>4. Respire</h4>



<p>&#8220;Respire&#8221; oozes with sensuality.  The melody is catchy yet very intimate.  DEX&#8217;s attractive voice stands out well to the theme of the song. This track twinkles in your ear making you desire more of it.</p>



<h4>5. Pushing Daisies</h4>



<p>Despite the title being reminiscent of death, &#8220;Pushing Daisies&#8221; is full of life and emotion. Heartbreaking and poignant, this track laments the fall of a past relationship and the &#8220;What ifs&#8221;. Despite the bleak color of the lyrics, the instrumental is full of electric intrigue and brightness, bringing an excellent contrasting texture to an already impressive piece. </p>



<h4>6. My Impulse</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="[VOCALOID Original PV] My Impulse [DEX]" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F_MPc1RD3UM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The serene yet uncertain piano intro slowly escalates to a heavy guitar riff accompanied by an alarming melody, a warning that something is not right. This heavy electro-rock song shouts anxiety and how it happens even in the safest of places &#8211; and how you just want someone to &#8220;Tell me it&#8217;ll be alright /&nbsp;Tell me that I will be fine&#8221;. &nbsp; </p>



<h4>7. Infinity</h4>



<p>Arguably one of the most atmospheric tracks in the whole album. This song is a hero&#8217;s journey. Starting with a very shaky beginning, the apprehensive singer finds someone they look up to. As the splashes of the beats heighten, the hero opens up and strives to fight with the one they love to get their place in &#8220;Infinity&#8221;.</p>



<h4>8. Suffocate</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Suffocate [Official Audio]" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/geGvhywints?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>&#8220;Suffocate&#8221; is minimalist in the verses, holding out to sharpen and then escalates in the chorus. Intoning the lopsided power dynamics in their relationship, the satisfying rhymes and rhythm of the song leave the end of the story in ambiguity. </p>



<h4>9.  <strong>Pacify</strong> </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="[VOCALOID Original PV] Pacify [Hatsune Miku]" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoDjnQBqRJY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>A ballad about a relationship teetering at the edge of collapse. The singer is &#8220;Clinging and holding&#8230;&#8221; to keep her partner. The track builds up at the last chorus asking if there &#8220;Is there a way to pacify the pain?&#8221;</p>



<h4>10. Both Of Us</h4>



<p>Groovy instrumentals and lyrics bursting with confidence paint this duet of miscommunication to life. With either side belting to say that the quarrel is not solely one&#8217;s fault, nostraightanswer shows that Dex&#8217;s and Daina&#8217;s vocals were made to complement each other. </p>



<h4>11. Half-Life</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="[VOCALOID Original Song] Half-Life [AVANNA]" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-nhwTl1w7cU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Avanna begs for the companionship of a savior and how being apart would cause her grief. Grounded and unwinding the track soothes, contrasting the urgency of the lyrics to &#8220;stay still with me&#8221;. Like the title, the song contains messages that show how nature is withering from our misuse. </p>



<h4>12. You Get Me</h4>



<p>&#8220;You Get Me&#8221; discharges confidence from the intro to the coda, and all the lyrics inbetween. Most noteworthy, the pre-chorus sings intensity and drops to a catchy minimalist beat. And with that, the track closes SYNTECH+ with a powerful finale.</p>



<h4>Personal thoughts</h4>



<p>SYNTECH+ is an emotional roller coaster of a journey. First of all, I find it really interesting how the album captures a wide array of emotions and how every track encompasses a unique story. Another thing is that I would usually have a song that I would skip in an album, but SYNTECH+ doesn&#8217;t have any of those for me. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s good to note that the previously released tracks were remastered and &#8220;given new life&#8221; by Nostraightanswer. The changes were minimal yet so well done (especially in &#8220;Define Me&#8221;) that it is worthy to say that these are the penultimate versions. Furthermore, if I had to pick a favorite track (which is like picking your favorite child), it would have to be &#8220;Pushing Daisies&#8221;, because I fell in love with that song since I first heard it as Daina&#8217;s Demo. I was able to join Lupin&#8217;s live stream when he was finishing that song and I cried (more than I want to admit). Finally, I can say that SYNTECH+ will be joining the list of my favorite albums. </p>



<h2>Announcements</h2>



<p>SYNTECH+ is available right now on <strong>Bandcamp</strong>. And will be available in <strong>every other major music provider and streaming service</strong> on <strong>August 20</strong>, <strong>2019</strong>.<br><br>Lupin also announced that he will be releasing the &#8220;part two&#8221; of the project called, SYNTECH-. It will be a self-cover and remix album. SYNTECH- will be releasing on <strong>August 20, 2019</strong>.</p>

<h2>Album Review</h2>



<p>We will now be going through every track to get a feel of the album. The theme of the album is Kizuna AI going beyond the digital world to connect with us. Thus the title &#8220;Hello, World&#8221;.</p>



<h2>Hello Morning</h2>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kizuna AI - Hello, Morning (Prod.Nor)" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4byaJ9w47uU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>



<p>Kizuna Ai welcomes everyone with a &#8220;good morning&#8221; in this upbeat electronic dance track. A perfect song to begin the album.</p>



<h2>Future Base</h2>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kizuna AI - future base (Prod.Yunomi)" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yeD7eAuza74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>



<p>Like the title, This song is a light future bass where Kizuna AI asks you to reach your hand to accompany her to the future. Kizuna AI&#8217;s soft vocals come through to bring the solemnity of the song together.</p>



<h2>New World</h2>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kizuna AI - new world (Prod.Yunomi)" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q_dnENXIcPg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>



<p>New world is full of excitement and joy from the begin to the last beat. This is an uplifting electronic song of invitation to the future. Sprinkled in between are beat drops that bring extra bounce to the music.</p>



<h2>Over the Reality</h2>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kizuna AI - over the reality (Prod.Avec Avec)" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OIdlW0u3ZXc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>



<p>Your journey to the future with Kizuna AI continues &#8220;over the reality&#8221;. The track is sugary sweet through and through. Kizuna AI&#8217;s raps make the song even cuter than it already is.</p>



<h2>Miracle Step</h2>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kizuna AI - miracle step (Prod.Nor)" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eolXxm37-8Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>



<p>Another future bass track that encourages you to take a new step looking forward positively. When you&#8217;re feeling down and need a bit of a pick me up, this is the song for you.</p>



<h2>Hello, Morning (Pa&#8217;s Lam System Remix）</h2>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kizuna AI - Hello, Morning（Pa&#039;s Lam System Remix）" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LyJ5vCAYZXQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>



<p>Midway through the album, we are ushered to the second half of the album by Pa&#8217;s Lam System&#8217;s re-energized remix of the opening song. If the original did not make you want to dance, then this will.</p>



<h2>Melty World</h2>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kizuna AI - hello,alone (Prod.MATZ)" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NJGPF7t368E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>TeddyLoid and Kizuna AI work together on this track like butter on toast. This high power EDM track commands attention with the lyrics and beats it throws at you. This is a signature TeddyLoid song. Everything about the song is straightforward from the vocal chops to every word, making this my top favorite.</p>



<h2>Hello, Alone</h2>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kizuna AI - hello,alone (Prod.MATZ)" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NJGPF7t368E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>



<p>Kizuna AI asks how long &#8217;till you wake up and meet her in &#8220;Hello, Alone&#8221;. This song has good progression and beat drops that feel just right. To be honest, Kizuna AI&#8217;s vocals sound a bit strained for the key of the song, but it&#8217;s still a fantastic track that you would expect from MATZ.</p>



<h2>Meet You</h2>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kizuna AI - meet you (Prod.DÉ DÉ MOUSE)" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w3nSFJ4MQ7M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>



<p>Kizuna AI wants to &#8220;Meet You&#8221; in this strong 80&#8217;s inspired track. &#8220;Meet You&#8221; brings fabulous disco vibes with a powerful EDM progression.</p>



<h2>Mirai</h2>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kizuna AI - mirai (Prod.☆Taku Takahashi)" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRCqXIBFRhU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>



<p>&#8220;Mirai&#8221; wraps all the previous tracks to a perfect present. Kizuna AI continues her journey to the future with you no matter the distance. With nods to &#8220;Future Base&#8221; and &#8220;Hello, World&#8221;, it is a wonderful finale to the digital releases.</p>



<h2>AIAIAI</h2>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kizuna AI - AIAIAI (feat. 中田ヤスタカ)【Official Music Video】" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S8dmq5YIUoc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>



<p>Yasutaka Nakata, well known for producing <a href="https://www.perfume-web.jp/eng/biography/">Perfume</a> and <a href="http://kyary.asobisystem.com/">Karyu Pamyu</a> <a href="http://kyary.asobisystem.com/">Pamyu</a>&#8216;s albums, collaborated with Kizuna AI to bring AIAIAI. The song is full of love and cuteness. The simple beats and surprising dance breaks make this song feels like you are at a festival.</p>



<p>This debut album fits the theme and aesthetic of Kizuna AI so well that only Kizuna AI could pull it off. She truly is a super AI that can do anything even going to the future with all her fans</p>

<h2>Album Review</h2>
<p>In this review, I will describe my impressions of each track from the <em>Dark Chocolate and Maraschino Cherry</em> album, particularly focusing on the themes addressed, the musical developments, and how Meiko&#8217;s vocals are used.</p>
<h3>Hourglass</h3>
<p>The album begins with this whimsical number, which tells a story of love and longing and seems to have elements of both jazz and folk. I think Meiko&#8217;s soulful voice suits this one well.</p>
<h3>Blink</h3>
<p>In the next track, we have what appears to be another love song but the tone becomes a little more serious and seductive, emphasising the maturity in Meiko&#8217;s voice.</p>
<h3>Love me, Hate me, but you can&#8217;t ignore me</h3>
<p>This song begins with bass and claps which exude attitude, and we hear Meiko speak as well as sing, which showing off her sassy side. The theme of this song, as the title suggests, seems to be of self-confidence and determination.</p>
<h3>Imposter Syndrome</h3>
<p>Things get a little darker in this track. It starts with a beat that grows in intensity and otherworldly sound effects which give off a trance-like vibe. The song summons imagery of space and appears to tell a story of insecurity and envy which evolves into hope and strength.</p>
<h3>The Starfishers</h3>
<p>One of the few Japanese tracks on this album, this track is a soothing and relaxing with a sort exotic folk feel to it, accentuated by the use of plucked strings, a harmonica, and even a whistling accompaniment. Meiko sounds so sweet and sincere in this song, and I think it&#8217;s one of my favourites on the album.</p>
<h3>Dynamite</h3>
<p>Again the tone changes for this next song, featuring a range of synths for a retro and somehow foreboding sound while the vocals play to the strengths of Meiko&#8217;s mature voice.</p>
<h3>Undoubtable Feelings</h3>
<p>The next song switches up the genres again and hits us with a heavy metal track about love and betrayal, where we hear Meiko scream with emotion with the backing of intense guitar and drums. I think this tune was the one that surprised me most on the album, as I don&#8217;t think I have ever heard Meiko used for this type of song before. I was amazed at how diverse her voice can be.</p>
<h3>Why Are You Romeo?</h3>
<p>In this track, striking piano and strings evoke emotion as Meiko sings a tragic love story about injustice and an unavoidable fate. In sad songs like this, I personally feel that Meiko&#8217;s voice successfully sounds emotional, as if she might cry.</p>
<h3>Twilight&#8217;s Fading</h3>
<p>&#8220;Twilight&#8217;s Fading&#8221; feels as if it were not of this world. The music echoes and travels as if the listener is floating in a dreamscape. Meiko&#8217;s voice almost feels like it&#8217;s flying far away and calling for you to follow her to a distant land. I personally found this song really relaxing.</p>
<h3>Remainer</h3>
<p>The album concludes with another Japanese track, which has a gentle and whimsical feel to it. Various instruments are used &#8211; from piano and strings to brass and drums. This song feels full of life and wonder. I was reminded of soundtracks from Studio Ghibli films like <em>My Neighbour Totoro</em> and <em>Arietty</em> while listening to it! It certainly left me smiling.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I feel that this album demonstrates the versatility of Meiko&#8217;s voice across various genres and is a thoroughly enjoyable album for any Vocaloid fan. I would certainly recommend it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Monds is back with another review of IA.. wait no, ONE! Yes, this time I am here to talk about ONE&#8217;s newest album &#8220;ONE/01 -Bloom-&#8220;. If you guys have followed VNN&#8217;s review, you know that around this time of year I usually make my way to Otakuthon. Yes, I know this was in August but hey, its never too late to talk about ONE is it? With that being said, you know who else usually attends Otakuthon? None other than 1st Place themselves, and they never disappoint with their booth and merchandise. Which means that I cannot help but leave there with some sort of merchandise. Enough talking about me though, the highlight here is ONE and her album</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1619.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-180674" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1619.jpg" alt="" width="402" height="569" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1619.jpg 432w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1619-212x300.jpg 212w" sizes="(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px" /></a></p>
<h2>The Album</h2>
<p>Let me just say this off the bat, from the few albums I own from 1st Place, one thing is guaranteed, there is always a varied compilation of songs and genres of music. I can almost guarantee that  90% of you would be hard-pressed to say that there is not a single song on any of the albums that you do not like. I assure you that the ONE album is no different.</p>
<p>
<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1624.jpg'><img width="432" height="682" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1624.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1624.jpg 432w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1624-190x300.jpg 190w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" /></a>
<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1631.jpg'><img width="432" height="662" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1631.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1631.jpg 432w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1631-196x300.jpg 196w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" /></a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The album starts with one of my favourite ONE songs &#8220;ミライ(Mirai, Future)&#8221;. You know when the album starts with this song from ATOLS, you are in for a nice ride through music lane. Moving on through the songs, I was not let down with my previous statement either. Right after this epic ATOLS song, it is followed by &#8220;Citrus&#8221; which also tingles my senses. What better way than to have the second song on your album be an electronic and upbeat song to get your blood pumping! Of course, any form of electronic music is generally up my alley so this was a given for me.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t8JXBtezzOc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Moving on to the third song &#8220;前夜 (Zen&#8217;ya)&#8221;, 1st Place stopped and said, wait a minute, lets turn the dial the other way a bit. And indeed they did, this song has a jazzy tone to it, although jazz is not my favourite choice for music, I always appreciate it when I hear it. Moving on to &#8220;星の後日談(Hoshi no Gojitsudan, Future Star)&#8221;, this one is a bit different, it does have a bit of a jazzy feel to it as well but at a much faster pace, I can appreciate that very much.</p>
<p>Next in line would be &#8220;LOVEマシーン(LOVE Machine)&#8221;, lets be honest here, we couldn&#8217;t have an album without some sort of reference to love now could we? Well, of course not! Don&#8217;t worry though, this is not a slow and sad feeling song, so, if you are sensitive to those type of songs, you have been saved! For now&#8230; Fast forward to &#8220;おねがいダーリン OИEgai Darlin&#8217;, ONEgai Darlin'&#8221; I see what they did there, they went from a love reference to darling&#8230; why not? Hey, if the song is good, there is nothing wrong with a bit of love in an album! Once again, another fast paced one. Within the song there is some sort of talking going one which is great to showcase ONE&#8217;s speech, however, I do not know Japanese, therefore I cannot say too much on the matter.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm26099756" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-180646 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/nico-1024x488.png" alt="" width="618" height="295" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/nico-1024x488.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/10/nico-300x143.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/10/nico-800x381.png 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/10/nico.png 1275w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a></p>
<p>Speaking of not knowing Japanese, &#8220;カピパラではなく、カピバラです。Kapipara de wa Naku, Capybara desu., It isn&#8217;t &#8216;Kapipara&#8217;, but &#8216;Capybara&#8217;.&#8221; This is where it&#8217;s mostly ONE speaking and I once again cannot speak on behalf of what is being said, it has more of a RAP feel to the song. So yes, it is a song and I quite enjoy it. ONE talking is always cute no matter the situation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm26207821" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-180659 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/nico2-1024x491.png" alt="" width="618" height="296" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/nico2-1024x491.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/10/nico2-300x144.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/10/nico2-800x383.png 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/10/nico2.png 1275w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a></p>
<p>Next on the volume dial is &#8220;てるみい(Tell Me)&#8221;, that is exactly what I am doing is telling you about this album! This one actually features 3 vocals on here, IA, IA Talk and ONE, a great combination to showcase the two of them together. In case you are wondering, there is a fair amount of speech on this album, which is never a bad thing, this song specifically gives it a live feeling.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="618" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zaNQmr04w2k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Now if you got this far and are telling yourself &#8220;wait a minute there Monds&#8221;, don&#8217;t tell me you are here to tell us how great fast paced and upbeat songs are? I sort of am? However, don&#8217;t worry, this is where we turn the dial down all the way to 2. What do I mean by 2? We have a slow song for those of you who prefer these. I mean, you could probably have a nice little waltz to this song if you wanted to, its quite fitting. The next one is &#8220;延命治療 Enmei Chiryou&#8221; This one is nothing new to IA fans as this is a cover from Neru and was originally sung by IA. With that being said, ONE&#8217;s cover does the song justice and will not disappoint.</p>
<p>We are almost at the end of the album with &#8220;アウターサイエンス(Outer Science)&#8221;. Now, unlike the previous song, this is not a cover but a remix. At the beginning of the song it sounds like we are getting ready to head in an epic battle of huge proportions. Don&#8217;t let it distract you from how good this song is though, because it isn&#8217;t long before this song turns into a bit of dubstep and then transitions into some rock, which is sure to please a good amount of you out there. You might want to crank the bass on this one though, let me tell you, the bass is not lacking in this song.</p>

<p>And to finish things off, we have &#8220;Into Starlight&#8221; as the last song of the album, do I need to say anything about this song? If you have not listened to it yet, then you need to go to YouTube right now and listen to it! Just kidding, you can click below and I will have it linked to make it easier for you.</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>DVD</h2>
<p>Of course as is often the case with these albums from 1st Place, it also includes a DVD with some good stuff on it. First thing you can find on these are the instrumental versions of &#8220;ミライ(Mirai, Future)&#8221;, &#8220;Citrus&#8221; with IA&#8217;s vocals as well as  &#8220;おねがいダーリン OИEgai Darlin&#8217;, ONEgai Darlin'&#8221;, &#8220;カピパラではなく、カピバラです。Kapipara de wa Naku, Capybara desu., It isn&#8217;t &#8216;Kapipara&#8217;, but &#8216;Capybara&#8217;.&#8221; and  &#8220;延命治療 Enmei Chiryou&#8221;. Although these are not of any use to me, I know for a lot of you these are great to have.</p>
<p>Next in line is 3 music videos of  &#8220;ミライ(Mirai, Future)&#8221;, &#8220;てるみい(Tell Me)&#8221; Which includes IA and ONE sporting their TEAM ARIA and TEAM IA outfits.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tell-me.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-180632" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tell-me-1024x617.png" alt="" width="618" height="372" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tell-me-1024x617.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tell-me-300x181.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tell-me-800x482.png 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tell-me.png 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a></p>
<p>There is also the music video for &#8220;Into Starlight&#8221;. Let&#8217;s be honest, who doesn&#8217;t like nice HD videos to go with great songs featuring IA and ONE? I mean, I know I don&#8217;t. To finish off my review, the last thing on the DVD is &#8220;ARIA STATION -ARIA ON THE RADIO-&#8220;, which, once again, I do not understand Japanese and I do not see any English subtitles so I can&#8217;t comment too much on this front. I can however, sit here and listen to their cute voices for 12 minutes and 4 seconds, which is quite relaxing. Before you ask, I did not actually do that&#8230;or maybe I did? You shall never know!</p>
<p>Finally, the album also includes 3 ONE postcards, a booklet with the lyrics for the songs(Japanese) and a merchandise leaflet.</p>
<p>
<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1633.jpg'><img width="150" height="150" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1633-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1633-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1633-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>
<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1638.jpg'><img width="150" height="150" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1638-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1638-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1638-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>
</p>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<p>Of course, I could not leave Otakuthon with just one item, I also picked up an IA shirt to go along with the rest of my IA and ONE shirts. This time, I got the TEAM IA shirt, as much as I wanted the team ONE shirt to go with my ONE album, for now, I chose the team IA one. I will get myself the team ONE shirt in the future, I assure you that! Stay tuned! I will say that this shirt is another nice one and I cannot emphasize enough how comfortable these types of shirt are, the material is soft and the colours are vibrant. Makes me wish all my shirts were as comfortable as these that I wear on a daily basis.</p>
<p>PS: They are not.</p>
<p>
<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1640.jpg'><img width="432" height="768" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1640.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1640.jpg 432w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1640-169x300.jpg 169w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" /></a>
<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1644.jpg'><img width="432" height="768" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1644.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1644.jpg 432w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1644-169x300.jpg 169w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" /></a>
</p>
<p>When I say this is a nice shirt, I mean it, it&#8217;s a nice shirt! If you don&#8217;t believe me, let&#8217;s put it this way, while going through airport security in Montreal with my shirt on the way back home, the security guard on the other aisle, not even the one on my side, stopped and shouted at me that I had a nice shirt. Yes, I am not making this up, the security guard stopped for a moment to tell me they liked my shirt! Now if that doesn&#8217;t say something about the shirt, then I don&#8217;t know what does.</p>
<p>You can read about my review of Otakuthon from last year <a href="/ia-otakuthon-merchandise-review/">here</a>, where I review more IA and ONE merchandise. You can also check out my review of IA/03 Vision and Lia&#8217;s collection album <a href="/ia03-vision-and-lia-collection-album-vol-2-crystal-voice-review/">here</a>.</p>

10. Meguri, natsu (exclusively composed for this book) by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/7620" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teaeye</a></p>
<p>Tracks 18-28 are the conversation practice files, which match up with practice sessions throughout the book.</p>
<p>For each practice session you come across in the book, the track number you need is stated at the top of the page.</p>
<h2>Book Content Details</h2>
<p>The book begins with an introduction to Miku herself, how to use the book and how to use SONOCA to download the files you will need to follow along with the songs and practice sessions.</p>
<p>The main contents of the book include an in-depth look at each of the 10 downloadable songs, including the lyrics (in Japanese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kanji</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Japanese" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romaji</a> and English), a look at the context and culture around the song, as well as conversation and writing practice.</p>
<p>The practice sessions cover various scenarios, from greetings and goodbyes to buying goods and discussing plans, like eating lunch together or going on trips.</p>
<p>In the casual conversation practice, you can use the conversation practice files to actually have a conversation with Miku!</p>
<p>The formal conversation practice is narrated by Mai Shouji and Shintaro Nimura.</p>
<p>For those of you who want to do the practice sessions, I recommend you pause the track after each line of Japanese is spoken, to allow yourself time to learn what the first speaker said, to give your answer and then to understand the response that the speaker gives.</p>
<p>After the song breakdowns, there are also sections of the book on Japanese grammar rules and pronunciation, as well as a guide on writing two of the three alphabets used by the Japanese, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hiragana</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katakana</a>. The writing guides feature 50 Hiragana and 50 Katakana.</p>
<p>As well as the information itself, it is worth noting that there are various illustrations featured throughout the book, including artwork by <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/9213" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KEI,</a> <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/2230" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iXima</a>, <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/13086" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mebae</a>, <a href="https://vocadb.net/Ar/16088" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pemu</a> and many more!</p>
